      <h1>About CryptoGamingToken</h1>

      <p><strong>
        CryptoGamingToken explores how context can be gamified, sorted, and qualified through digital track records — not to optimise attention, but to surface meaning.
      </strong></p>

      <p>
        Games have always measured players. Scores, rankings, timers, completion rates — all forms of context captured in motion.
        Yet most of these records disappear the moment the session ends, detached from any broader sense of identity,
        progression, or relevance.
      </p>

      <p>CryptoGamingToken exists to question that pattern.</p>

      <p>
        We’re interested in what happens when competitive systems are treated less like disposable entertainment
        and more like <em>persistent records</em> — systems that respect time, skill, and decision-making without
        collapsing everything into vanity metrics or engagement loops.
      </p>

      <p>
        This isn’t about turning life into a game.<br />
        It’s about recognising that many of the most meaningful signals people produce already emerge
        <em>through</em> play, challenge, and constraint — but are rarely preserved, compared, or understood in context.
      </p>

      <h2>A different approach to scoring</h2>

      <p>
        Most digital systems optimise for attention: more clicks, longer sessions, faster loops.
        Games are no exception.
      </p>

      <p>CryptoGamingToken approaches scoring from a different angle. Rather than maximising engagement, it asks:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What does a score <em>represent</em>?</li>
        <li>What context surrounds it?</li>
        <li>How should different performances relate to one another over time?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These questions sit at the core of the project, shaping how records are captured, sorted,
        and interpreted — without assuming that all activity is equal, or that all progress should look the same.
      </p>

      <h2>Current status</h2>

      <p>
        CryptoGamingToken is currently in an early design and validation phase.
      </p>

      <p>
        Public materials are intentionally high-level while foundational systems are being explored,
        tested, and refined. Some elements will remain abstract until they can be presented with clarity
        and integrity.
      </p>

      <p>
        This page reflects the <em>direction</em> of the project, not a finished specification.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Looking ahead</h2>

      <p>
        As the project matures, more detail will be shared around how these ideas are implemented and applied.
        Until then, CryptoGamingToken remains focused on first principles: context, qualification,
        and the long-term meaning of digital records.
