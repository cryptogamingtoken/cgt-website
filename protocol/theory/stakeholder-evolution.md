## 📊 Level 0 – System Genesis  
**Sprint ID:** pre‑R‑1z  
**Version Tag:** `v0.2.3-stakeholder-evolution`  
**Status:** ✅ Confirmed  

### 🔹 Overview
The following table outlines the initial state of all 10 stakeholder types at the launch of the CryptoGamingToken protocol.  
All stakeholders are assigned a baseline level `0.0`, or a sub-level `0.x` to represent contextual affordance, preparatory capacity, or passive visibility within the MVP structure.

### 🧩 Stakeholder Matrix – Level 0

| Stakeholder | Level | Affordances | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Founders** | 0.0 | (1) Platform custodianship, (2) roadmap control, (3) protocol definition authority | Control narrative, initiate protocol, manage all roles |
| **Core Developers** | 0.0 | (1) Build MVP backend, (2) Build MVP frontend, (3) leaderboard, (4) claims, (5) explorer, (6) wallet flow, (7) Publish Protocol Schema Draft | Enable full working model, publish protocol schema draft |
| **Marketing & Operations** | 0.0 | (1) Website publishing, (2) whitepaper comms, (3) community touchpoints (Telegram, CMC) | Starts publishing initial marketing, Sets up marketing channels |
| **Players** | 0.0 | (1) Enter main game, (2) receive scores, (3) claim mock rewards, (4) appear in explorer | Direct gameplay affordance, mock wallet system enabled |
| **3rd-Party GQT Creators** | 0.1 | (1) Protocol documentation available; cannot publish GQTs but can design around the config | Can develop conceptual GQTs but not participate in live protocol yet |
| **Reward Pool Organisers** | 0.1 | (1) View mock tournament/claim logic, (2) can simulate fees, not route real tokens | Systems visible; simulation enabled, no execution authority |
| **Stakers** | 0.0 | (1) No action at MVP; staking mechanics not live, no reward influence | Awaiting protocol hooks or validator overlays |
| **Ecosystem Builders** | 0.1 | (1) See structure of GQT/score claims; can architect future layers | Can prototype around system visibility |
| **CGT Service Providers** | 0.1 | (1) Begin identifying integration and monitoring opportunities | Early research and planning phase only — no onboarding tools live |
| **DAO / Sub-DAOs** | 0.1 | (1) No governance control or fund routing; passive observation only | Protocol visibility begins, but no active affordance |

---

### 🧠 Observations:
- Sub-levels (`0.1`) represent conceptual engagement and protocol alignment even without permission-based affordance
- No stakeholder has been artificially inflated above support systems
- First full-level unlocks will likely occur at Level 1, conditional on validator, staking, or publishing readiness

### 🧩 DAO / Sub-DAOs  
**Level 2 Prep – Governance Simulation Layer**
The DAO scaffolding layer activates — not yet with proposal mechanics or token voting — but with traceable monitoring of influence from all 9 stakeholder types. This simulation stage ensures no stakeholder gains early dominance and that protocol rule-setting can be transparently aligned with real-world engagement.

---

#### ✅ Core Actions at This Level:
- Simulate **protocol-wide influence tracking** per stakeholder type.
- Enable **mock governance registry**: a system that logs tagged contributions (e.g. tool authorship, GQT publishing, staking, etc.).
- Begin surfacing **contribution-weighted metadata signals** on dashboards, profiles, and GQT listings (e.g. “community-backed,” “validator-confirmed”).
- DAO UI begins exposing *read-only simulation* of possible proposal flows, vote weights, and trust thresholds — but remains non-interactive.

| **Founders**                | Protocol publishing rules, lifecycle logic, and stakeholder ladders must be locked in.                                                  | Authorship of system schema and lifecycle maps tagged with wallet and timestamp.                                       | Founders must embed non-permanent authority in protocol rules (DAO replaces control).                                  |
| **Core Developers**         | Governance scaffolding logic must exist (config flags, registry tags, simulation layers).                                               | Git commits, schema tags, and off-chain governance model updates linked to contributor identities.                     | Influence fades unless active contributions continue. Developers cannot hard-code themselves into protocol logic.     |
| **Marketing & Operations**  | Must have published educational content on GQTs, protocol use, and ecosystem responsibilities.                                           | Indexed materials tied to wallet-authored metadata (docs, X threads, pinned pages).                                   | Influence increases only if community adoption traces back to verifiable authored resources.                          |
| **Players**                 | Must have participated in real GQTs and either claimed rewards or crossed minimum participation thresholds.                             | Score claim logs, token claims, leaderboard entries linked to wallet and time.                                         | DAO tracks total participation weight over time; bots and duplicate plays can be filtered by trust thresholds.        |
| **3rd-Party GQT Creators**  | Must have published GQTs at the “Shareable Draft” or “Published” stage with verifiable participation or validator review.               | Indexed GQTs by creator wallet, tagged with trust signals, and validator logs.                                         | Influence capped unless validators or the platform confirm legitimacy.                                                |
| **Reward Pool Organisers**  | Must have run mock or real reward pool configs visible to the platform and test users.                                                  | Config submission logs, payout rule simulations, fee routing visibility.                                               | Influence scales with pool volume and diversity; DAO can reweight underused configurations.                            |
| **Stakers**                 | Must be actively staking CGT tokens with visible lock-up commitments under protocol rules.                                              | On-chain staking contract data, visible lock-up durations, reward routing balances.                                   | Influence decays without ongoing stake or community alignment. Dynamic models can rebalance against token whales.     |
| **Ecosystem Builders**      | Must have created external tools or overlays that interface with CGT protocol (even in testnet/mock mode).                             | Tool registry, usage analytics, and references inside official docs or dashboards.                                     | DAO can use signal propagation logic to verify real-world use vs dormant codebases.                                   |
| **CGT Service Providers**   | Must have offered onboarding or support services tied to at least 1 GQT and verified by the client side (wallet or creator log).        | Service verification attestations or metadata tags (e.g. “onboardedBy”: walletX).                                      | DAO can audit service legitimacy; providers gain influence only with usage or trust confirmations.                    |



### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Founders Level 0
#### Affordance: (1) Maintain platform custodianship and narrative control

**Definition:**
Founders maintain custodianship of the platform’s directional integrity, including its evolving multi-stakeholder narrative. This means defining the functional story arc of each stakeholder: how they evolve, earn trust, and gain influence; establishing the sequence of visibility (who appears first and why); and curating the founder’s voice as both central authority and meta-curator of role interactions.

**Strategic Function:**
This affordance isn’t just directional — it’s ecosystem-shaping. Founders are responsible for shaping the onboarding mental model of every other stakeholder. Their custodianship ensures alignment across stakeholder roles in tone, trust structure, and sequencing. Without it, the protocol loses coherence, and stakeholder growth becomes fragmented or misinterpreted.

**Dependencies:**
No external dependency, but custodianship must stay aware of ecosystem readiness — Core Devs (game loop), Players (usage and claims), Marketing (sandbox visibility), and Creators (GQT publishing activity). All of these affect how narrative timing must be exercised.

**Failure Risk:**
Protocol drift. Misaligned stakeholder assumptions. Conflicting onboarding experiences. Tone fragmentation. Premature decentralization vocabulary that undermines role formation.

**Proof:**
🧭 A stakeholder narrative map or onboarding draft that outlines role paths and growth arcs.  
🎓 Messaging in early docs, whitepapers, or platform UI that presents each stakeholder with clear functional positioning and purpose.  
📝 Public protocol updates or content pieces authored by Founders that explicitly signal directional control over stakeholder sequencing.

Status: ✅ Approved

#### 🔍 Expanded Affordance Statement

**🧭 Maintain platform custodianship and narrative control**  
  Steward platform custodianship and stakeholder narrative integrity through a functional story arc of each stakeholder—how they evolve, earn trust, and gain influence.

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Founders Level 0
#### Affordance: (2) Roadmap control

**Definition:**
Founders define, stage, and coordinate the release of all protocol components, stakeholder activations, and visibility milestones. This includes the timing and order of feature rollouts (e.g., mock game loop, publishing access, leaderboard claims), and the pacing of stakeholder participation across mock and live phases.

**Strategic Function:**
Roadmap control governs the protocol’s behavioral progression. It ensures simulation events happen in the correct order, builds stakeholder trust through visible stability, and avoids role confusion or premature feature exposure. Without it, the ecosystem may evolve in fragments or generate false signals of readiness.

**Dependencies:**
Requires observability of Core Dev progress (game loop stability), Player feedback (mock behavior patterns), Creator milestones (GQT publishing), and Marketing activation. Timeline adjustments must reflect readiness signals while preserving strategic staging intent.

**Failure Risk:**
Stakeholders activate out of sync. Features appear disconnected from usage context. Founders lose narrative authority over sequencing. Trust erodes due to chaotic pacing or reactive decision-making.

**Proof:**
🗺️ Founder-authored roadmap, milestone ladder, or release calendar  
📈 Time-locked activation of features and roles  
📣 Messaging in updates and onboarding that explains sequencing logic

Status: ✅ Approved

#### 🔍 Expanded Affordance Statement

**🧭 Roadmap control** 
  Control the release and activation timeline of protocol components and stakeholders, maintaining behavioral pacing and ensuring features are introduced in an order that supports trust, clarity, and inter-role sequencing.


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Founders Level 0
#### Affordance: (3) Protocol definition authority

**Definition:**
Founders carry the responsibility to define and communicate what constitutes the protocol during its formative, centralized stages. This includes establishing behavioral boundaries between core rules (e.g., rewards logic, GQT schema, leaderboard constraints) and experimental or application-layer features. This definition is transitional: it exists to create stability, coherence, and early trust until the ecosystem matures enough to self-define through usage, participation, and constitutional norms.

**Strategic Function:**
This affordance establishes the initial trust surface of the protocol. It allows other stakeholders to act with clarity in a mock environment and avoids ambiguity about what is canon. Crucially, it also signals that Founder authority is **provisional** — designed to be outgrown. Protocol legitimacy must eventually derive from stakeholder consensus, not Founder declarations.

**Dependencies:**
All stakeholders rely on this affordance for coordination. Core Devs build to canonical logic. Creators shape GQTs using official schema. Players and Stakers rely on declared reward behavior. Marketing messages gain coherence from clearly defined protocol status.

**Failure Risk:**
If protocol boundaries are undefined or treated as permanent Founder property, decentralization is compromised. If definitions shift without clarity, trust breaks. If the Founder never prepares to yield this role, constitutional legitimacy is delayed or rejected.

**Proof:**
📜 Public document or whitepaper section defines mock protocol vs. app behavior  
📐 GQT schema is versioned and declared canonical  
🧪 Mock reward and leaderboard behaviors declared as protocol primitives  
🗂️ Founders issue a time-aware declaration of what the protocol currently *is*, and what is meant to be replaced by the ecosystem

Status: ✅ Approved


#### 🔍 Expanded Affordance Statement

**🧭 Protocol definition authority**  
  Define and communicate the behavioral boundaries of the protocol during mock stages, distinguishing core rules and primitives from experimental or application-layer logic to ensure ecosystem alignment and future governance legitimacy.



### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Founders Level 1
#### Affordance: (1) Finalize GQT scaffolding

**Definition:**
Founders are responsible for finalizing the initial scaffolding of the GQT system — a behavioral composition model based on the core dimensions of Game, Quiz, and Test. This does not mean fixing a format or structure. It means establishing the axis logic and interaction rules that enable all protocol behavior to be expressed, simulated, and eventually governed with shared meaning.

**Strategic Function:**
This affordance defines the protocol’s universal behavioral grammar. By activating G/Q/T as composable logic primitives, the Founders create a foundation for all future forms of interaction — including games, assessments, experiences, and unknown hybrids. Scaffolding means clarity, not constraint: it opens pathways for developers, creators, and validators to align on behavioral identity.

**Dependencies:**
Core Developers interpret axis configs into logic branches. Players receive feedback based on G/Q/T behavior. Creators build using declared blends. Explorers and ecosystem tools begin indexing and visualizing behavior by axis profile. DAO framing will eventually rely on this foundation for gameplay trust layers.

**Failure Risk:**
Without this scaffold, compositional logic fragments. Player behavior is ungrounded. Creators design without shared affordances. Simulation becomes incoherent. The protocol drifts toward UX mimicry rather than protocol maturity. Trust never roots.

**Proof:**
📐 Schema or doc that defines G/Q/T as core protocol axes  
🧪 Early use cases or mocks declare and simulate G/Q/T blends  
📊 Ecosystem tools visualize axis identity per interaction  
🧭 Public Founder declaration: “What is GQT as a behavioral system”

Status: ✅ Approved

#### 🔍 Expanded Affordance Statement

**🧭 Finalize GQT scaffolding** 
  Finalize the initial scaffolding of the GQT behavioral system by establishing Game, Quiz, and Test as the core compositional axes of protocol logic—providing the foundational grammar that underpins all future gameplay, evaluation, and interaction formats.


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Founders Level 1
#### Affordance: (2) Finalize Core Schema

**Definition:**
Founders are responsible for finalizing the minimum viable core schema of the protocol — a structural framework that models the presence, roles, and relationships of all stakeholders during the protocol’s formative stage. “Finalize” at this level does not mean completing all schema contents, but rather defining the scaffold that can accommodate live, mock, or placeholder entries for each core participant type.

**Strategic Function:**
This affordance enables the entire stakeholder ecosystem to be modeled and simulated in advance of live protocol activation. By defining schema visibility and ownership conventions, Founders lay the groundwork for coordination, versioning, access control, and cross-stakeholder interaction. This structure guides artifact emergence, simulation, and readiness scoring across all future layers of evolution.

**Dependencies:**
Players depend on schema entries to claim, submit, and view participation history.  
Creators require schema mappings to publish and track GQTs.  
The DAO relies on consistent schema indexing for future governance tracking.  
Developers use the schema as the source of truth for implementation paths.  
The publishing and exploration layers depend on schema visibility to present system-wide state.

**Failure Risk:**  
Without this affordance, the protocol cannot coordinate stakeholder affordances or validate readiness.  
Artifact emergence is fragmented.  
Evolution pathways become invisible or ambiguous.  
Mock systems cannot scale or synchronize.  
DAO transition becomes structurally impossible.  
The protocol remains reactive rather than governed.

**Proof:**  
📐 Schema folder exists with stakeholder-type folders (e.g. `players/`, `founders/`)  
📘 Schema entries are versioned and named via artifact alignment  
🔖 All active L0/L1 stakeholders have at least one schema entry

#### Affordance: (3) Finalize Narrative Shape

**Definition:**
Founders are responsible for setting the core narrative scaffolding that defines the protocol’s identity, arc, and alignment logic. This does not mean defining every message or campaign. It means framing the worldview that shapes how GQTs, games, and stakeholder roles are interpreted and evolved across the ecosystem.

**Strategic Function:**
This narrative creates internal coherence. It ensures that developers, creators, players, and ecosystem builders are not just building components—but participating in a shared evolution. A strong narrative enables alignment without top-down enforcement. It governs protocol shape through meaning rather than mandates.

**Dependencies:**
Marketing translates narrative arcs into public-facing content. Players interpret scoring as part of a larger purpose. DAO evaluations hinge on shared origin stories and framings. The schema itself gains clarity and trust from the presence of a unifying arc. Narrative shape also influences game dynamics, artifact labeling, and even incentive design.

**Failure Risk:**
Without this affordance, the protocol fragments into disconnected features and game mechanics. Builders make incompatible assumptions. Players don’t see continuity between games. DAO narratives splinter. Trust collapses not from bad behavior—but from incoherent meaning.

**Proof:**
📖 Narrative doc or scaffold that defines the protocol worldview  
🌀 GQTs show traceable alignment to this story structure  
🗺️ Public documentation reflects shared terminology and framing  
🪞 Schema and artifact names remain purpose-driven and technically clear — but can be reverse-mapped into the protocol’s worldview to reinforce shared meaning (e.g., “explore” → explorer, “block” → game cycle, “evolution” → version ladder)

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Founders Level 1
#### Affordance: (4) Lead mock protocol specification

**Definition:**
Founders are responsible for shaping and publishing the initial specification of the protocol in mock form. This does not mean defining every rule or constraint — it means producing a coherent system sketch that captures how the protocol behaves, rewards, governs, and evolves during its pre-chain phase.

**Strategic Function:**
This affordance ensures the entire ecosystem has a stable behavioral reference. While not yet blockchain-enforced, the mock specification governs the logic of GQT configs, reward flows, leaderboard claims, role boundaries, and artifact routing. It enables simulated affordance testing across all stakeholders before hard commitments.

**Dependencies:**
Developers implement mock behavior using this spec. Ecosystem creators align with versioning, routing, and reward definitions. Players earn based on the system described here. Marketing references this as the source of “how CGT works.” DAOs will eventually ratify or replace it with on-chain equivalents. Founders remain accountable for coherence during the simulation era.

**Failure Risk:**
Without a clear mock specification, the protocol functions as a loose federation of tools. Claims and rewards become arbitrary. Affordance modeling collapses. No schema can hold. No gameBlock can be trusted. Ecosystem actors build contradictory assumptions. The entire behavioral core risks fragmentation before decentralization even begins.

**Proof:**
📘 `/specs/protocol-mock-spec-v1.json` or equivalent human-readable spec  
🧪 Mock affordance tests reference this document as source of truth  
🔁 GQT configs, routing logic, and gameBlocks align with this version

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers  Level 0 
#### Affordance: (1) Build MVP Backend

**Definition:**  
Core Developers are responsible for constructing the backend logic that enables mock gameplay operations, score recording, claim validation, and leaderboard output. This includes server-side routes, database schemas, mock session auth, and any logic necessary to simulate protocol behavior prior to on-chain implementation.

**Strategic Function:**  
The backend forms the **behavioral spine** of the protocol. It allows Players, Founders, and Reward Organisers to interact with GQT-like experiences while the actual CGT token and blockchain stack are still in planning. It also acts as the simulation base for schema testing, affordance triggers, and ecosystem readiness scoring. This affordance ensures the protocol can **exist as a coherent system** before any smart contract is deployed.

**Dependencies:**  
Players depend on backend logic to submit scores and trigger leaderboard responses.  
Claim validation relies on backend rules for timing, eligibility, and uniqueness.  
Marketing needs endpoints to showcase demos and walkthroughs.  
Founders simulate core protocol interactions through backend state.

**Failure Risk:**  
Without a functioning backend, the protocol cannot simulate play, score, or reward.  
No stakeholder can meaningfully test their affordances.  
Mock ecosystem progress halts.  
The protocol remains speculative, blocking narrative alignment, schema validation, and DAO evolution.

**Proof:**  
🧪 Mock gameBlock simulation logic (e.g., POST `/api/submit-score`)  
🗂 Leaderboard and claim routes live in API structure  
📊 Database schema matches evolving GQT config logic  
📘 Documented mock spec aligned with implementation

#### Affordance: (2) Build MVP Frontend

**Definition:**  
Core Developers are responsible for building the front-end interface that enables all other stakeholders to interact with the mock protocol. This includes rendering leaderboards, score submission forms, claim buttons, wallet selection UIs, and state-based views of the evolving mock ecosystem.

**Strategic Function:**  
The frontend acts as the **public mirror of the protocol’s logic**, translating backend and schema operations into understandable interactions for Players, Founders, and external observers. It is also the platform where simulation affordances are visualized, tested, and refined. The MVP frontend builds **trust through transparency**, allowing all stakeholders to see what the protocol is becoming — even before it exists on-chain.

**Dependencies:**  
Players use the frontend to participate in GQTs, submit scores, and claim rewards.  
Founders rely on it to validate schema visibility and protocol clarity.  
Marketing captures screenshots, walkthroughs, and demo material from the UI.  
The DAO will later inherit this visibility layer for auditing and trust signaling.

**Failure Risk:**  
Without a usable frontend, no stakeholder can engage with the protocol.  
Affordances remain invisible or untestable.  
Simulation fails to generate feedback loops.  
Public trust cannot form.  
DAO onboarding and reward logic cannot be visualized.  
Momentum collapses.

**Proof:**  
🖥️ Publicly accessible UI (Vercel or equivalent) showing mock leaderboard  
📤 Score submission + claim action paths rendered visibly  
🎭 Mock wallet connect and token gating components simulate real flow  
🧩 GQT draft configurations reflected in public view  
🔍 Developers publish README or walkthrough of simulation UI logic

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers  Level 0 
#### Affordance: (3) Implement Leaderboard (Mock MVP)

**Definition:**  
Core Developers are responsible for implementing a mock leaderboard system during the MVP phase. This includes constructing the frontend UI and backend logic necessary to submit, rank, and display player scores — all within a simulated, off-chain environment. The leaderboard does not rely on CGT token logic but must reflect accurate score states and time-windowed gameplay boundaries.

**Strategic Function:**  
The leaderboard is the backbone of visible competition and progression during the mock phase. It allows all stakeholders to test, explore, and communicate around the protocol’s reward logic, game cycles, and participation structure. It anchors player motivation, organizer routing simulations, and ecosystem dashboard experimentation — making it one of the most critical developer-built artifacts at Level 1.

**Dependencies:**  
- **Players** rely on the leaderboard to verify score submissions from the mock main game. Without visible ranking feedback, gameplay loses continuity and motivation breaks down.  
- **Reward Pool Organisers** simulate reward splits based on leaderboard position. Without score outputs, prize routing logic has no testable input.  
- **Marketing & Operations** use leaderboard states in guides, mock screenshots, and educational flows to explain scoring, progression, and claiming. Their public-facing work depends on coherent, viewable mock data.  
- **Ecosystem Builders** prototype score explorers, dashboards, and overlays that visualize leaderboard trends. These tools require stable mock data to simulate protocol health, top player streaks, or score evolution.  
- **Founders** depend on the leaderboard to validate that schema objects and affordance boundaries perform coherently in a multi-stakeholder simulation.

**Failure Risk:**  
If the leaderboard is not implemented and maintained as a functional mock, Level 1 testing collapses across multiple roles.  
- Player affordance becomes invisible.  
- Prize simulations by Organisers are unverifiable.  
- Explorers built by Ecosystem Builders have no data stream.  
- Narrative scaffolding from Founders becomes ungrounded.  
- Documentation and onboarding by Marketing cannot teach protocol logic.  
The entire simulation phase is rendered inert — mock protocol cohesion fails before decentralization even begins.

**Proof:**  
🖥️ Mock leaderboard visible in the frontend during a running game cycle  
🧪 Backend logic supports score submission, time windows, and ranking  
📊 Leaderboard data is consumable by explorers, guides, and simulations  
🧩 Scores linked to player mock wallets and claim eligibility  
📸 Used in educational screenshots and walkthroughs

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers  Level 0 
#### Affordance: (4) Implement Mock Claim System

**Definition:**  
Core Developers are responsible for designing and implementing a mock claim system that enables players to redeem rewards based on their leaderboard positions. While no real CGT is issued, the mock system simulates eligibility, verifies claim status, and returns a stubbed transaction hash to signal successful redemption. The claim system is session-authenticated and integrated into the gameBlock lifecycle.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance enables the “earn-and-claim” feedback loop foundational to CGT’s gameplay economy. Even at the mock stage, it teaches players how participation yields measurable rewards and prepares the backend for on-chain transitions. It also supports marketing demo flows, ecosystem visualizations, and reward eligibility testing for future GQTs.

**Dependencies:**  
• **Players** rely on this system to validate leaderboard performance and claim earned rewards in mock form.  
• **Founders** define the claim cycle duration, expiry policy, and reward allocation logic simulated here.  
• **Reward Pool Organisers** use this mock system to preview prize logic, routing formats, and fee considerations for future live routing.  
• **Ecosystem Builders** depend on claim status flags to power historical displays, claim dashboards, or time-sensitive overlays.  
• **Developers** themselves use this logic to test GQT config compatibility with reward claims and gameBlock flows.

**Failure Risk:**  
Without this affordance, players cannot simulate redemption or trust leaderboard cycles. Reward flows remain invisible, making the main game meaningless. No simulation of expiration, scaling, or routing logic is possible. Ecosystem builders and reward pool designers have no mock reference to align their overlays or future routing logic. Trust in early gameplay mechanics would break, stalling adoption.

**Proof:**  
✅ `/api/claim` route accepts valid session wallet and score metadata  
✅ Server verifies eligibility, returns mock txHash, prevents duplicate claims  
✅ Claims tied to gameBlock IDs and stored with status metadata in Postgres  
✅ Frontend shows claim eligibility, loading state, success/failure feedback  
✅ Explorer UI updates claimed/unclaimed states per wallet and gameBlock  
✅ Claim attempts expire after 28-day mock window (or equivalent stubbed logic)

Status: ✅ Approved

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers Level 0  
#### Affordance: (5) Build Explorer Interface

**Definition:**  
Core Developers are responsible for delivering the initial mock version of the protocol’s Explorer — a centralized, read-only UI that visualizes scores, claims, and leaderboard participation. At Level 0, this interface is fed by a mock backend (e.g. PostgreSQL) and reflects off-chain protocol logic without any on-chain indexing or Merkle proofs.

**Strategic Function:**  
The Explorer allows players to confirm their presence in the system, developers to verify schema logic in action, and founders to demonstrate a working MVP ecosystem. Though not yet connected to blockchain infrastructure, this layer is critical for ecosystem transparency, schema testing, and early onboarding trust. It supports public visibility into the leaderboard, claim eligibility, and gameBlock participation.

**Dependencies:**  
Players depend on the Explorer to view their scores and mock claim eligibility.  
Founders use the Explorer to demonstrate stakeholder visibility and system behavior.  
Reward Pool Organisers simulate payout logic by referencing leaderboard state.  
Marketing surfaces Explorer snapshots to show how protocol rewards and visibility work.  
Ecosystem Builders prototype overlays and indexing logic based on Explorer outputs.

**Failure Risk:**  
Without the Explorer, the protocol functions as a black box.  
Mock claims and rewards are unverifiable.  
Stakeholders cannot validate their own entries or understand protocol behavior.  
Testing becomes opaque, limiting feedback and breaking trust cycles.  
Schema remains abstract, with no visual linkage to real usage.  
The entire ecosystem simulation risks collapse due to lack of visibility.

**Proof:**  
📺 `/explorer` route renders leaderboard, scores, and claims  
🧪 Score and claim data matches schema mock entries  
🔍 Basic search or filtering by wallet or gameBlock  
📸 Screenshots or documentation include Explorer walkthroughs  
🧭 Referenced by founders, players, and builders as a validation tool

Status: ✅ Approved


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers Level 0 
#### Affordance: (6) Build Wallet Flow

**Definition:**  
Core Developers are responsible for designing and implementing the initial wallet interaction system during the MVP mock phase. At Level 0, this means creating a simulated wallet flow that allows users to "log in" with a mock wallet address, maintain session state, and link that address to scores and claim eligibility within the local system. No real blockchain transactions occur — identity is mimicked through frontend session logic or mock address generators.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance lays the foundation for all wallet-based affordances across the ecosystem. It allows the protocol to simulate end-to-end user identity: from playing a game, submitting scores, and appearing on a leaderboard, to claiming mock rewards. It supports gameplay, rewards, mock authorization, and sets the standard for how future wallet interactions will function when the real token and smart contract layers activate.

**Dependencies:**  
Players depend on this flow to simulate access gating, leaderboard participation, and claim actions.  
Founders rely on this to demonstrate a working prototype and validate identity logic.  
Reward Pool Organisers use wallet-score mappings to simulate reward splits and claim logic.  
Ecosystem Builders rely on this format to build overlays or wallet-explorer tools.  
Marketing & Ops reference the login/claim journey in documentation, screenshots, or onboarding flows.  
DAO/Sub-DAOs may later analyze wallet-linked data once schema and explorer affordances evolve.

**Failure Risk:**  
Without a working wallet flow, all gameplay, claiming, and leaderboard testing breaks.  
Players cannot track identity or access simulated rewards.  
Developers lose the ability to validate claim logic.  
Founders cannot demonstrate a functional end-to-end mock.  
The entire Level 0 protocol breaks cohesion and fails to simulate a blockchain-like experience.

**Proof:**  
🧪 Players can log in using a mock wallet address.  
🔑 Session logic persists scores and enables mock claim actions.  
📊 Leaderboard and explorer views reflect wallet-linked entries.  
📸 Login/claim journey can be documented for onboarding materials.  
📁 Mock wallet identity logic is isolated and testable in codebase.

Status: ✅ Approved

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers  Level 0
#### Affordance: (7) Publish Protocol Schema Draft

**Definition:**  
Core Developers are responsible for producing the initial schema drafts that define stakeholder roles, data models, and system behavior. At Level 0, this includes creating mock or draft-only files that outline how components like claims, score entries, GQT configurations, and metadata should be structured — even if these files are not yet enforced by code or validated through usage.

**Strategic Function:**  
Publishing a schema draft creates the foundation upon which the mock protocol, reward logic, GQT configs, and explorer tools are built. It gives Founders, Players, Creators, and Organizers a shared source of truth. By making stakeholder flows explicit, Core Developers transform invisible coordination into structured system logic — a prerequisite for scaling, simulation, and future decentralization.

**Dependencies:**  
- Founders depend on these schema drafts to lead the mock protocol specification.  
- Players depend on claim-entry and score-entry schemas to simulate gameplay and rewards.  
- 3rd-party Creators begin mapping their GQT config drafts around the exposed schema formats.  
- Reward Pool Organizers and Ecosystem Builders prototype routing, scoring, and overlays based on the schema’s logic shape.  
- DAO schema indexing starts here — even if passively — enabling future version tracking.

**Failure Risk:**  
Without a published schema draft:  
- System behavior remains implicit, forcing contributors to guess the structure.  
- Mock logic becomes fragile and unscalable.  
- Founders cannot finalize the mock specification.  
- Players lose visibility into score/claim boundaries.  
- Creators cannot align with routing or reward expectations.  
- DAO transitions have no artifact to track schema evolution.  
The entire protocol becomes locked inside the codebase, preventing strategic collaboration.

**Proof:**  
📁 Draft schemas exist for `/score-entry.json`, `/claim-entry.json`, and `GQT.json`  
🔖 Files include `schemaVersion`, `specStatus`, and stakeholderTag metadata  
📘 All stakeholder types in use have at least one corresponding schema entry or placeholder  
🧭 Developers publicly document schema shape or issue a spec-to-schema mapping summary

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers Level 1
#### Affordance: (1) Build a playable mock version of the main CGT game

**Description:**  
Develop a functional front-end and mock back-end to simulate the core CGT game loop. This includes player input, score generation, UI responsiveness, and interaction with leaderboard logic — all without on-chain components. The experience must simulate gameplay credibly enough to allow testing, feedback, and iteration.

**Strategic Function:**  
The mock game is the first touchpoint for Players and a testbed for validating how scores, session data, and token gating logic will interact later. It enables the Founders and Developers to observe player behavior, stress test UX logic, and ensure that the leaderboard and reward mechanics are built on solid foundations.

**Dependencies:**  
- Players depend on this mock game to test playability and feedback loops.  
- Founders use this version to define what “winning” means and plan reward logic.  
- Leaderboard logic and claim tracking are triggered by gameplay outcomes.  
- Marketing & Operations may record footage or screenshots for promotional use.  
- 3rd-party Creators begin understanding CGT structure by studying game behavior.

**Failure Risk:**  
Without a playable mock version:  
- No gameplay loop can be tested.  
- Players and testers cannot explore the system.  
- Leaderboards remain disconnected from live interactions.  
- Founders cannot validate pacing or rules.  
- Early marketing and creator education is stalled.

**Proof:**  
🎮 Front-end game client renders mock game with working controls  
🧪 Test scores are generated via gameplay, not static entries  
💾 Sessions link gameplay → score → leaderboard entries  
📈 Observed player behavior informs UI/UX feedback cycles

**Status:** ✅ Implemented


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers Level 1
####  Affordance: (2) Simulate leaderboard logic for ranking players off-chain

**Description:**  
Develop and deploy the leaderboard system using mock data and off-chain logic to rank players by score. This affordance includes implementing ranking algorithms, supporting pagination or filtering, and rendering scoreboards tied to mock game sessions. All logic must be verifiable through mock payloads and player actions without relying on real tokens or wallets.

**Strategic Function:**  
The leaderboard is the centerpiece of the CGT experience. Even in a mock state, it simulates competitive dynamics, validates game logic, and serves as the primary reference point for player achievement. It allows Players, Founders, and Creators to test cycles, and begins shaping behavioral expectations for score-based rewards.

**Dependencies:**  
- Players must see their scores reflected immediately after gameplay to simulate reward conditions.  
- Founders need real-time visibility to test leaderboard logic and design cycles.  
- Marketing & Ops begin building narratives around leaderboards for promotional content.  
- Ecosystem Builders and Service Providers may prototype overlays, filters, or mock exports.

**Failure Risk:**  
If leaderboard simulation is incomplete:  
- Players cannot validate gameplay outcomes.  
- Reward logic becomes untestable.  
- No visibility into who wins, loses, or ranks — blocking all downstream affordances.  
- Core Developers lack a baseline to measure session activity and interaction.  
- Founders cannot design token distribution cycles or gameBlock intervals.

**Proof:**  
📊 Leaderboard UI renders score, wallet, rank, and block ID  
📑 Back-end logic handles mock POST score entries and GET ranking queries  
🛠️ Data stored in Postgres or equivalent mock store  
✅ Mock entries tied to unique wallet sessions with constraints to avoid abuse

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers Level 1
Affordance: (3) Implement score submission logic

**Description:**  
Build the backend and frontend hooks that allow a player, identified by a mock wallet session, to submit a score at the end of each game round. The logic must validate input, timestamp the submission, associate it with the correct gameBlock, and pass the result to the leaderboard-ranking service. All storage remains off-chain in the mock database layer.

**Strategic Function:**  
Score submission is the handshake between gameplay and every downstream system (leaderboard, reward distribution, explorer views). Reliable, tamper-checked score capture ensures the mock ecosystem can produce meaningful competitive data, test reward thresholds, and surface player history.

**Dependencies:**  
- **Build mock main game flow** → provides the raw score to be submitted.  
- **Simulate leaderboard ranking logic** → consumes validated scores to update ranks.  
- **Simulate off-chain reward distribution** → relies on stored scores for eligibility checks.  
- **Link leaderboard to mock claim system** → needs persisted score IDs for claim records.

**Failure Risk:**  
If score submission fails or is unreliable:  
- Players lose trust (scores disappear or duplicate).  
- Leaderboard accuracy collapses, blocking reward tests.  
- Founders cannot verify game-block pacing or fairness.  
- Marketing suffers—screenshots and demos show inconsistent data.

**Proof:**  
✅ `POST /api/score` route accepts wallet session + score payload.  
✅ Backend writes entry with gameBlock ID, timestamp, and checksum.  
✅ Duplicate-submission guard prevents spam.  
✅ Leaderboard updates within mock latency SLA (<500 ms).

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting

🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers Level 1
Affordance: (4) Create session-based token-gating logic

**Description**  
Implement a lightweight access-control layer that mimics CGT wallet checks. When a player “connects” a mock wallet, the backend records the wallet address in the session and tags it as **gated** (allowed) or **ungated** (blocked). All main-game routes, score-submission calls, and claim endpoints verify this flag before permitting gameplay or reward actions. No real tokens move; the flag simply stands in for a future CGT-balance check.

**Strategic Function**  
Token-gating logic lets the team verify that gameplay, score storage, and reward claims can be protected behind wallet ownership—even in an off-chain mock. It prepares Players for the CGT login experience, helps Founders validate access boundaries, and gives Marketing a concrete “connect wallet, play game” flow to showcase.

**Dependencies**  
- **Build mock main game flow** → checks the session flag before loading gameplay.  
- **Implement score submission logic** → accepts scores only from gated sessions.  
- **Simulate off-chain reward distribution** → verifies eligibility using the same flag.  
- Future Level 2 wallet integration will replace the mock flag with on-chain balance checks.

**Failure Risk**  
Without gating:  
- Anyone can access the game without a wallet, breaking CGT’s core premise.  
- Score and reward tests lose meaning—no link between identity and gameplay.  
- Founders can’t validate how wallet checks impact UX or performance.  
- Later on-chain integration becomes riskier and requires refactoring instead of a simple swap.

**Proof**  
🔑 `POST /api/session/connect` stores mock wallet + `isGated: true/false`.  
🛠️ Middleware denies `/game`, `/submit-score`, and `/claim` for ungated sessions.  
🧪 Unit tests cover “gated plays → score accepted” vs. “ungated plays → blocked”.  
📸 Demo flow: connect mock wallet → play → submit score → claim (if gated).

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers  Level 1
#### Affordance: (5) Simulate off-chain reward distribution

**Definition:**  
Core Developers implement the reward logic that runs after each gameBlock ends. Based on leaderboard rankings, the system calculates mock rewards and stores them in a claim-ready state tied to each wallet address. This simulation mimics how real blockchain-based token rewards will be distributed in the future.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance ensures players can experience a realistic version of leaderboard-driven incentives without actual CGT tokens. It closes the loop between gameplay and reward by letting users claim simulated prizes based on rank and gameBlock logic — vital for stress-testing the incentive model, verifying fairness, and previewing future systems.

**Dependencies:**  
- **Simulate leaderboard ranking logic** → must finalize placements before rewards can be calculated.  
- **Implement score submission logic** → feeds valid entries into each gameBlock’s dataset.  
- **Link leaderboard to mock claim system** → must reference these calculated rewards.  
- Prepares system for **gameBlock-to-claimable-mapping** on future chains (e.g., Solana, Arweave).

**🚫 Failure Risk:**  
If the mock reward distribution is omitted or left incomplete:
- Players will have no way to preview reward expectations or ranking incentives.  
- Claim validation cannot reference expected reward amounts.  
- Leaderboard engagement will lack consequence or feedback, reducing motivation.  
- Testing downstream logic like reward claiming, pagination, and claim timing will be blocked.

> 🔒 Risks are limited to skipped or underdeveloped logic — not architectural flaws — assuming correct use of mock gameBlock finalization and reward calculation strategy.

**✅ Proof:**  
💾 Cron/job runs after each gameBlock → populates `mock_rewards` by rank.  
📄 Rewards reference `scoreEntries` and generate mock txHashes for claim traceability.  
📘 Rewards are viewable in the History Explorer and testable via API.  
🔐 Claims fail if reward is missing or already claimed (validates logic loop).


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Core Developers  Level 1
#### Affordance: (6) Link leaderboard to mock claim system

**Description**  
Expose a user-facing claim flow that allows a wallet-session to redeem the mock reward generated for its leaderboard rank.  
The backend checks:  
1. The wallet has a score entry in the finalized gameBlock.  
2. A matching reward row exists in `mock_rewards`.  
3. No prior claim for that (wallet, gameBlock) pair exists.  
If all pass, it writes a record to `mock_claims`, marks the reward as claimed, and returns a mock `txHash` to the client.

**Strategic Function**  
This completes the play-earn-claim loop. Players see tangible value for performance; Founders verify eligibility logic and anti-double-claim protection; Marketing can demo the thrill of “collecting winnings,” and Reward Pool Organisers can observe distribution timing. It readies the protocol for a later swap-in of an on-chain claim contract.

**Dependencies**  
- **Simulate off-chain reward distribution** → supplies the reward records being claimed.  
- **Implement score submission logic** → ensures leaderboard entries are authentic.  
- **Create session-based token gating logic** → validates wallet identity before allowing a claim.  
- Explorer & History tools read `mock_claims` to display claim status.

🚫 **Failure Risk**  
If this link is missing or flawed:  
- Players cannot redeem rewards, breaking incentive credibility.  
- Duplicate or fraudulent claims may occur without proper checks.  
- Metrics on claim latency and user engagement remain untested.  
- Marketing loses a critical success-state demo.

✅ **Proof**  
🔗 `POST /api/claim` verifies wallet, gameBlock, and reward eligibility.  
🛑 Duplicate claim attempt returns `error: already_claimed`.  
💾 Successful claim inserts `{wallet, gameBlockId, reward_amount, mock_txHash}` into `mock_claims`.  
📜 Front-end claim button shows “Claimed” with mock hash on success.  
🧪 Unit tests cover valid, duplicate, and ineligible claim scenarios.

#### Affordance: (3) Publish Early Reward Pool Simulation Breakdowns  

**Definition:**  
At Level 1, Marketing & Operations are responsible for publishing digestible breakdowns of early reward pool simulations. These are not investor reports but communication artifacts that explain—in clear, narrative-driven terms—how mock prize pools behave under different configurations. The intent is to provide transparency, demystify the reward logic for non-technical stakeholders, and prepare the ground for creators and organisers to design with confidence.  

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance establishes Marketing as the bridge between backend economics and community comprehension. By translating reward simulation outputs into plain language, visuals, and narratives, Marketing ensures that stakeholders (creators, organisers, players) understand how reward pools scale, split, and expire. This builds confidence in the fairness and adaptability of the system before live token routing begins.  

**Dependencies:**  
- **Founders (L1 – Finalize Core Schema, Lead Mock Protocol Spec):** Provide baseline definitions of routing fields and timing windows.  
- **Core Developers (L1 – Simulate Off-Chain Reward Distribution, Explore Fee Logic, Explore Reward Splits):** Supply the raw mock simulation data to be translated.  
- **Reward Pool Organisers (L1 – Simulate Prize Logic, Explore Routing Options):** Depend on Marketing outputs to validate whether their config logic is understood by the broader ecosystem.  
- **Players (L1 – Claim Rewards from Sandbox Leaderboards):** Need clear, public-facing explanations of why rewards appear as they do to maintain trust.  
- **DAO / Sub-DAOs (L1 – Passive Schema Monitoring):** Index the published artifacts as readiness signals, using them to verify that reward transparency obligations are being met.  

**Failure Risk:**  
If early reward pool simulations are not published:  
- **Organisers** may misjudge how to configure pools and later feel blindsided by actual reward economics.  
- **Creators** could design GQTs without anticipating routing or split logic, leading to wasted effort or misaligned mechanics.  
- **Builders** would lack concrete data anchors, resulting in dashboards or overlays that fail to match future outputs.  
- **DAO** logs would miss key readiness artifacts, leaving transparency gaps in the economic layer.  
- **Founders and Developers** would appear to be withholding critical information, weakening credibility at the exact stage when openness is expected.  

The absence of these breakdowns doesn’t just create general opacity — it directly undermines trust in **reward distribution mechanics**, eroding confidence in both organisers and the wider economic narrative.

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Marketing & Operations Level 1  
#### Affordance: (4) Share Structure via X and Documentation  

**Definition:**  
At Level 1, Marketing & Operations is responsible for publishing the structural foundations of the protocol — including mock API demos, early schema explanations, and strategic framing — through public channels such as X and formal documentation. This is not polished marketing; it is scaffolding visibility. The intent is to show that the protocol has internal shape, logic, and trajectory, even while it remains centralized and founder-operated.  

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance turns the protocol’s hidden structure into visible signals. By sharing scaffolding on X, in whitepaper drafts, and in evolving docs, Marketing demonstrates that CGT is more than a speculative idea: it is an organized system with rules, roles, and direction. This builds trust, prepares external observers for Level 2 activity, and funnels early adopters into the ecosystem. Importantly, at this stage, all “Marketing” outputs are authored directly by the Founder — serving as both documentation and a recruiting signal for future stakeholders.  

**Dependencies:**  
All stakeholders rely on this affordance for clarity, even if the Founder is the one operating multiple roles at this stage:  
- **Founders** → Depend on published structure to assert narrative control and avoid ambiguity in multi-role execution.  
- **Core Developers** → (Founder-operated) Require structured comms to validate and externalize their own mock implementations; future high-performing players may enter via these signals.  
- **Players** → Depend on X threads, guides, and docs to understand how to engage with the mock game, leaderboard, and claims.  
- **3rd-Party GQT Creators** → Rely on structural explanations to begin designing drafts around config rules and schema. At this stage, they emerge as a small subset of players responding to these signals.  
- **Reward Pool Organisers** → Depend on documented prize, claim, and fee logic to simulate their workflows.  
- **Stakers** → Depend on structural transparency around dormant commission slots and reward schedules for future alignment.  
- **Ecosystem Builders** → Rely on published schema and mock API demos to architect overlays, dashboards, and early tools.  
- **Service Providers** → Depend on these outputs to simplify and reframe structure for creators and onboarding.  
- **DAO / Sub-DAOs** → Depend on whitepaper/docs/X comms as passive schema-indexed signals, forming their readiness ledger.  

**Failure Risk:**  
If structural publishing via X and documentation is weak or absent:  
- Stakeholders act in silos without a shared protocol shape.  
- Players lose clarity on how their actions connect to wider protocol logic.  
- Creators cannot align drafts with system scaffolding.  
- Organisers and Stakers cannot simulate fair routing.  
- Builders and Service Providers lack anchor points for overlays or guides.  
- DAO readiness ledger is incomplete, weakening future governance legitimacy.  

**Proof:**  
- 📄 Whitepaper drafts circulated with evolving schema and scaffolding sections.  
- 🧾 Documentation folder containing mock API endpoints, schema outlines, and role explanations.  
- 🧵 X threads publishing structure snapshots, narrative cues, and protocol demos.  
- 🔎 Explorer and mock API demos linked from X and docs to show structural logic in action.

🔍 **Expanded Affordance Statement**  
📢 **Share Structure via X and Documentation**  
Turn hidden protocol scaffolding into visible public signals by publishing mock API demos, schema explanations, and early narrative framing on X and in documentation — ensuring all stakeholders have clarity and legitimacy anchors, even while these roles remain Founder-operated at Level 1.

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Players Level 0  
#### Affordance: (1) Enter main game

**Definition:**  
Players can enter and participate in the primary mock game experience hosted on the CGT platform. This includes loading into the game environment, interacting with the UI, and initiating actions that simulate real GQT behavior — such as submitting answers, scores, or making choices. Access is enabled through the mock wallet system.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance anchors **the entire user loop** by allowing individuals to participate as test players before real token logic or permission gating is introduced. It ensures the platform is playable from day one, creates the basis for score tracking and reward testing, and provides the behavioral data required to simulate future economic flows.

**Dependencies:**  
- Core Developers must implement backend logic to host the main game and handle user interaction.  
- Mock wallet session must be active to track users and associate results.  
- Game state must reset or respond appropriately per session or gameBlock.  
- Leaderboard system must accept and store submitted scores.

**Failure Risk:**  
If this affordance is missing or buggy:  
- Users cannot experience the core CGT concept.  
- Testing of other affordances (score submission, rewards, explorer) is blocked.  
- Engagement is stalled due to lack of interaction flow.  
- Ecosystem perception may suffer as the project appears non-functional.

**Proof:**  
🎮 Main game renders on web client upon login via mock wallet  
📥 Score submission API is triggered from game completion  
🧾 Wallet address and result are stored in mock database  
📄 Game activity is traceable in the Explorer via wallet address  
👥 Multiple users can concurrently simulate interaction

**Status:** ✅ Live & Testable


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Players Level 0  
#### Affordance: (2) Receive Scores

**Definition:**  
Once players complete a GQT interaction — whether a game, quiz, or test — the system calculates a score based on performance. This score reflects accuracy, efficiency, or achievement depending on the GQT type and config, and contributes directly to leaderboard rank.

**Strategic Function:**  
Score feedback is the **core reward signal** across all GQT types. It reinforces effort, provides outcome clarity, and links the experience to downstream systems such as leaderboards, mock rewards, and ecosystem trust visibility. Scoring is the **unifying mechanism** that makes all GQTs measurable and comparable.

**Dependencies:**  
- Core Developer logic must calculate, store, and return scores after any GQT session.  
- GQT config must define scoring criteria (e.g., correct answers, completion time, game events).  
- Leaderboard system must assign the score to the correct wallet for the current gameBlock.  
- Explorer tools must display score history by wallet and GQT instance.

**Failure Risk:**  
Without reliable scoring:  
- Players lose feedback on how they performed in a game, quiz, or test.  
- Leaderboards cannot reflect effort or ranking.  
- Mock rewards tied to scores become meaningless.  
- Trust in the protocol’s integrity declines.

**Proof:**  
📈 Score output visible immediately after any GQT session  
🗂 Score entry stored with player wallet and gameBlock metadata  
🔍 Score retrievable via leaderboard or explorer view  
📊 Score influences leaderboard rank and mock reward eligibility  
🧪 GQT simulation tests confirm score generation and boundary behavior

**Status:** ✅ Live & Testable


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Players Level 0  
#### **Affordance: (3) Claim Mock Rewards**

**Definition:**  
Players are able to claim simulated rewards after participating in a GQT (Game, Quiz, or Test). Once a gameBlock ends and leaderboard rankings are finalized, eligible wallets can initiate a mock claim based on their score and placement. This action mimics how future CGT token claims will be performed once blockchain logic is active.

**Strategic Function:**  
Claiming closes the GQT loop — connecting participation, performance, and payoff. It introduces the **expectation of value**, reinforcing behavior patterns such as recurring play, leaderboard climbing, and strategic timing. This affordance also allows the protocol to test reward eligibility logic, gameBlock cycle closure, and claim expiration rules. Even in a centralized context, this builds muscle memory for how rewards will function under real staking and token emissions.

**Dependencies:**  
- Rewards must be **pre-calculated** via the reward distribution logic (Core Developers).  
- Scores must be **valid** and mapped to eligible gameBlocks.  
- The **Explorer** must display the claim’s result for traceability.  
- Wallet or session identity must persist across game participation and claiming.

**🚫 Failure Risk**  
Without the ability to claim:  
- The core motivation loop is severed, and player engagement stalls.  
- Leaderboards have no tangible consequence.  
- Testing for future CGT flow breaks at the critical handoff point.  
- Reward expiration logic and timing validations cannot be trialed.  
- Players cannot preview what claiming will look or feel like.

**✅ Proof**  
📤 `/api/claim` route exists and responds to valid claim requests.  
🔐 Claims are one-time and tied to `(wallet, gameBlock)` to prevent duplicates.  
📆 Claim deadlines are tested against mock expiration windows (e.g., 28 days).  
🧾 History Explorer displays successful and failed claims.  
📘 Mock txHashes or claim IDs simulate blockchain traceability.

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Players Level 0  
#### **Affordance: (4) Appear in Explorer**

**Definition:**  
After participating in a GQT and submitting a score, Players can see their past entries, ranks, and claims within a centralized History Explorer. This allows users to trace their performance across gameBlocks and verify rewards, participation status, and leaderboard history.

**Strategic Function:**  
The Explorer provides visibility, transparency, and feedback — critical for player retention and ecosystem trust. It allows Players to self-audit their journey and see tangible evidence of their GQT engagement. This visibility also enables future replay analysis, strategic optimization, and community credibility (e.g., using score history for talk show invitations or DAO onboarding).

**Dependencies:**  
- Scores must be recorded and timestamped.  
- Claims must be logged and linked to the player wallet or session ID.  
- Leaderboard data must be mapped to gameBlocks.  
- Explorer UI must support filtering, pagination, and session-specific lookup.

**🚫 Failure Risk**  
Without Explorer visibility:  
- Players cannot validate their GQT participation or rewards.  
- Errors in score recording or reward distribution remain opaque.  
- There’s no incentive to improve or analyze performance.  
- Trust in the system is degraded, harming future transition to on-chain explorers.

**✅ Proof**  
🧭 Centralized Explorer interface exists (web-based).  
🔎 Players can search by wallet address and filter by gameBlock or claim status.  
📜 History shows timestamps, scores, and leaderboard rank per entry.  
🔐 Claimed vs unclaimed status is shown per leaderboard cycle.  
📘 Pagination and range filtering are implemented and tested.

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Players Level 1  
#### Affordance: (1) Engage with Simulated GQT Experiences

**Definition:**  
Players can now interact with fully simulated GQTs — including games, quizzes, and tests — built by core developers or shared by creators. These mock experiences run through a centralized system that replicates real GQT lifecycle mechanics such as start triggers, input recording, and feedback loops.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance establishes **behavioral readiness** for protocol-level interactions. By playing through simulated GQTs, players experience how actual protocol mechanics will behave when live — including score handling, session state, eligibility constraints, and UI/UX expectations. This affordance ensures that players are **trained, tested, and immersed** in a GQT-centric mindset before token-gated or live versions are deployed.

**Dependencies:**  
Founders: Defined the GQT scaffolding and mock spec players now experience  
Core Developers: Built mock GQT logic, submission routes, and leaderboard behavior  
Marketing: Provided walkthroughs to guide player onboarding  
GQT Creators: May share sandboxed GQT drafts with players for exploration

**Failure Risk:**  
Without this affordance, players would have **no grounded understanding** of how to navigate GQT mechanics.  
Protocol feedback loops remain untested by actual users.  
Future affordances like staking, claiming, or governance may suffer from **low contextual adoption** due to lack of prior simulation.  
Ecosystem readiness signals for player roles would be absent.

**Proof:**  
🕹️ GQT experiences (games/quizzes/tests) are available for play via the frontend  
🛠️ Players submit inputs and receive simulated outcomes (scores, feedback, rankings)  
📜 Routes for GQT interactions are documented and accessible (e.g., `/api/gqt/:id/play`)  
🎓 Players participate in test runs that mirror future tokenized experiences  
📊 Submission data shows live mock GQT usage in backend logs

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Players Level 1  
#### Affordance: (2) Access Token-Gated Mock GQTs

**Definition:**  
Players can now attempt to access simulated GQTs that are restricted behind mock token-gating logic. While no CGT tokens are yet live, the system emulates access control using mock sessions, wallet logic, or scripted eligibility conditions. This enables realistic simulation of tiered participation, gated access, and staking-preconditioned entry.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance tests the **barrier mechanics** of the CGT protocol — mimicking how real token-based gating will function. It creates friction points that filter participation, ensuring only qualifying users (by role, score, or eligibility) gain access to certain experiences. This prepares the ecosystem for **future CGT-controlled entry** and sets the groundwork for premium GQTs, staking thresholds, and gated tournaments.

**Dependencies:**  
Core Developers: Implement token-gating logic and eligibility checks (mocked)  
Founders: Define what types of GQTs are gated and under what conditions  
Reward Organisers: May simulate gated GQTs tied to prize logic  
Players: Must use wallet sessions or meet mock eligibility to access

**Failure Risk:**  
Without this affordance, token-based control mechanisms remain **unproven**.  
Players lack context for access tiers, token staking, or CGT-based restrictions.  
Simulated premium GQTs would be indistinguishable from public ones, reducing test fidelity.  
Protocol evolution would skip over one of the **core mechanics** of access control and privilege.

**Proof:**  
🔐 Gate logic restricts access to certain mock GQTs based on simulated wallet/session/score  
🧪 Eligibility paths documented for each gated GQT  
🎮 Players receive access denial or success response with consistent UI feedback  
🧾 Logs show gated GQT attempts and resolution state  
📘 Documentation outlines mock-token-gate schema and test conditions

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Players Level 1  
#### Affordance: (3) Claim Rewards from Sandbox Leaderboards

**Definition:**  
Players who participate in sandboxed GQT drafts (created either by core developers or 3rd-party GQT Creators) can earn and claim **test CGT** rewards. These rewards are distributed based on performance in mock leaderboard rankings tied to each sandboxed GQT instance.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance serves as the **primary real-world simulation** of what future CGT-based claiming will look like. It lets the ecosystem test reward distribution mechanics, UI patterns, eligibility logic, and leaderboard configuration **before live token deployment**. It also offers **low-friction feedback loops** to evaluate reward pool logic, onboarding flows, and behavioral responses without economic consequences.

**Dependencies:**  
- Requires Core Developers to build sandbox leaderboard flows with working reward logic  
- Depends on GQT Creators publishing drafts with working leaderboard → score → reward flow  
- Relies on mock token infrastructure and clear UI labeling to distinguish test CGT from real CGT  
- Benefits from Ecosystem Builders creating visual dashboards or overlays showing test claim data  

**Failure Risk:**  
- If this affordance fails, players lack hands-on experience with the claim flow  
- Early reward tuning cannot be tested  
- UI/UX for rewards is unverified  
- No dry run exists to catch leaderboard config errors or user edge cases  
- The system risks launching live rewards without sandbox validation, raising breakage risk

**Proof:**  
🧪 Test CGT reward data stored and retrievable per player  
📊 Leaderboard entries visibly trigger test reward eligibility  
🛠️ UI elements (e.g., "Claim Test CGT") present and functional  
📁 Distinction between mock main game rewards and sandbox draft test CGT rewards  
📘 Documentation or tooltip clarifies that rewards are testnet-only and non-monetary  

Status: ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Players Level 1  
#### Affordance: (4) Participate in Shareable Draft GQTs (TestCGT)

**Definition:**  
Players can actively join GQTs created in Shareable Draft Mode and deployed by either Core Developers or 3rd-Party GQT Creators. These GQTs run on the TestCGT mock economy layer, and while they must conform to protocol rules and logic, they are isolated from the live token environment.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance enables broad-scale user testing, gameplay balance feedback, and protocol trialing without risking the integrity of the final CGT token. It accelerates ecosystem growth by allowing parallel experimentation and early onboarding into the GQT structure.  

It also provides the only real method of pre-launch gameplay for experimental GQTs that are not part of the main mock game and allows the community to explore content that may be listed post-launch.

**Dependencies:**  
- Core Developers: must support Shareable Draft functionality and protocol compliance checks  
- 3rd-Party GQT Creators: must create compliant GQTs in draft mode  
- TestCGT reward system: must be in place for sandboxed and shared drafts  
- Protocol Schema: must define what rules are enforced in draft mode  

**Failure Risk:**  
- GQTs in draft mode fail to follow protocol logic or offer misleading gameplay  
- Lack of engagement may prevent testing of core reward logic  
- Players may not clearly understand the distinction between TestCGT and real CGT  
- Potential feedback loops are missed before protocol launch  

**Proof:**  
🧪 Players successfully enter draft GQTs through frontend links or shared URLs  
📊 Score submission and participation data logged in TestCGT-mode environments  
🛠️ Shareable GQTs offer basic reward previews and display protocol conformance  
📁 Mock reward logic observed during gameplay sessions  

Status: ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Players Level 1  
#### Affordance: (5) Follow Protocol Walkthroughs and Guides

**Definition:**  
Players can access and follow official walkthroughs, quick-start guides, and onboarding materials that explain how to participate in the **pre-launch & sandbox ecosystem** — specifically: joining the mock main GQT, entering Shareable Draft GQTs (TestCGT), submitting scores, viewing leaderboards, and claiming test rewards.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance lowers friction for players to **successfully play mock and draft GQTs** using the flows that exist at Level 1. Clear, accurate guides reduce confusion around mock wallet sessions, token-gating behavior, leaderboard timing, and the distinction between **MockCGT (main MVP)** and **TestCGT (draft GQTs)**. It ensures consistent participation and correct use of claim paths ahead of live CGT.

**Dependencies:**  
- **Marketing & Operations** – author and publish player-facing guides that reflect current Level-1 behavior.  
- **Core Developers** – keep guides accurate by aligning UI labels, endpoints, and flows with documented steps.

**Failure Risk:**  
- Players misinterpret token-gating or reward eligibility, leading to failed or duplicate claim attempts.  
- Confusion between MockCGT and TestCGT reduces trust and participation.  
- Support load increases due to missing or outdated instructions.  
- Inconsistent player behavior skews early testing data (leaderboard/claim stats).

**Proof:**  
🧩 Guides exist in the docs site and are linked from relevant UI states (e.g., “How to enter a Draft GQT”).  
🧪 Spot-checks confirm guide steps match live endpoints and UI labels.  
📈 Basic analytics show guide views correlate with successful joins/claims.  
📝 Known-issues/FAQs section tracks resolved player misunderstandings.

Status: ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – 3rd-Party GQT Creators Level 0  
#### Affordance: (1) Protocol documentation available; cannot publish GQTs but can design around the config  

**Definition:**  
At Level 0, 3rd-Party GQT Creators gain access to **core protocol documentation** detailing configuration parameters, structural rules, and component interoperability for GQTs. While they cannot publish live GQTs or participate in the active protocol, they can begin **designing conceptual GQTs** around these specifications for future deployment.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance ensures creators can start aligning their concepts with the protocol’s technical and gameplay constraints **well before live participation is unlocked**. It seeds the ecosystem with ready-to-build concepts and encourages early familiarisation with the GQT framework, minimising the learning curve when publishing rights are granted at higher levels.

**Dependencies:**  
- Requires Founders to release a publicly accessible protocol documentation set  
- Depends on Core Developers maintaining accurate and up-to-date config specifications  

**Failure Risk:**  
- Without access to protocol documentation, creators cannot prepare viable GQT concepts in advance  
- Lack of early design alignment may cause rework when live publishing becomes possible  
- The ecosystem risks a slow onboarding of creator-driven content at higher levels due to unprepared participants  

**Proof:**  
📄 Protocol documentation is accessible to prospective creators  
📘 Documentation includes config rules, GQT component descriptions, and example structures  
🛠️ Creators produce draft designs or mockups referencing official config parameters  

Status: ⏳ Drafting  

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – 3rd-Party GQT Creators Level 1  
#### Affordance: (1) Build GQTs in Sandboxed or Shareable Draft Mode

**Definition:**  
3rd-Party GQT Creators can design and launch GQTs in **Sandbox** (private, test-only) or **Shareable Draft** (public via link) modes. Shareable Drafts may be **published** by the creator (live and embeddable under their control) but are **not platform-indexed/listed** by default; platform discovery remains gated by future validator/trust thresholds.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance provides a low-friction way to test GQT behavior “in the wild,” gather gameplay/quiz/test feedback, and validate reward and pacing—**without implying platform endorsement**. It reduces risk before creators choose to **publish** more broadly or request **platform indexing** later.

**Dependencies:**  
- Core Developers – draft/publish toggles, draft storage, and conformance checks.  
- Protocol Schema – defines what rules are enforced in draft modes.  
- Players – supply usage data by trying shared drafts.  
- (Founders) – clarify the semantics of **published (creator-controlled)** vs **platform-indexed**.

**Failure Risk:**  
- Without drafts, creators either ship straight to **Published** without iteration or stall entirely.  
- Lower quality/reward-logic defects reach audiences prematurely.  
- Confusion between **published** and **platform-indexed** states if semantics aren’t documented.

**Proof:**  
🧪 Creators can save a GQT as **Sandbox** or **Shareable Draft**.  
🔗 Shareable URLs work for external testers; creator can **publish** (live/embeddable) without platform indexing.  
📊 Draft play data (scores/completions) is captured for review.  
📘 Docs/UI clearly distinguish **Published (creator-controlled)** vs **Platform-Indexed (validator-gated)**.

Status: ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – 3rd-Party GQT Creators Level 1  
#### Affordance: (2) Share Externally

**Definition:**  
3rd-Party GQT Creators can share their GQTs outside the CGT platform by generating shareable links or embed codes. These GQTs may be hosted on the creator’s own channels, websites, or communities, allowing direct player engagement without requiring CGT platform discovery. This affordance operates with **no platform indexing until trust scores are implemented**, at which point only GQTs meeting the **minimum trust threshold** will be eligible for indexing.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance allows creators to independently promote and grow their audience, bypassing CGT’s native discovery tools until they meet trust requirements. It supports pre-launch momentum building, niche audience targeting, and early engagement testing. It also gives creators freedom to validate gameplay, scoring, and reward flow without waiting for platform listing eligibility.

**Dependencies:**  
- Core Developers: must provide shareable link/embed generation tools and hosting integration  
- Protocol Schema: must define which components remain sandboxed vs. public  
- Trust & Indexing Framework: must be ready before creators can apply for official indexing  

**Failure Risk:**  
- Without this affordance, creators are limited to platform-native discovery (when available), restricting early adoption  
- Audience growth may stagnate pre-trust score implementation  
- Creators unable to embed externally may struggle to build communities before indexing approval  
- Risk of unclear messaging to players about whether a GQT is officially indexed or independent  

**Proof:**  
🧪 Shareable links/embeds generated successfully from GQT creator dashboard  
📊 External player engagement tracked and attributable to GQT  
📁 GQTs remain non-indexed until trust score eligibility met  
📘 Documentation explaining indexing eligibility and trust thresholds  

Status: ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – 3rd-Party GQT Creators Level 1  
#### Affordance: (3) No CGT Listing

**Definition:**  
3rd-Party GQT Creators can publish GQTs without having them included in the CGT platform’s **homepage discovery, featured sections, or native search indexing**. These GQTs will still generate game blocks with their own leaderboards and will always remain accessible via the CGT Explorer, ensuring transparency and trackability. Indexing into CGT’s discovery features will only occur once the **Trust & Indexing Framework** is active and the GQT meets the **minimum trust score threshold**.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance allows creators to launch and promote their GQTs without waiting for discovery placement approval, while ensuring that only verified and trusted GQTs are showcased in high-visibility areas of the platform. This protects player experience, maintains platform quality, and prevents the promotion of unverified or low-quality content through official CGT channels, while still enabling gameplay, leaderboard competition, and explorer visibility from day one.

**Dependencies:**  
- Core Developers: must support non-indexed publishing with full leaderboard and explorer integration  
- Protocol Schema: must define the rules and conditions for discovery/indexing eligibility  
- Core Developers: must implement and manage the Trust & Indexing Framework, including minimum trust score requirements  

**Failure Risk:**  
- Without this affordance, unverified GQTs could be promoted prematurely in discovery areas, risking player trust  
- Creators may be blocked from launching if discovery approval is a prerequisite  
- Confusion may arise if there’s no clear distinction between discovery-listed and non-listed GQTs  
- Platform quality perception could suffer if discovery features are not protected by trust gating  

**Proof:**  
🧪 Creators can publish GQTs with leaderboard and explorer access but without discovery placement  
📊 Player engagement metrics remain trackable via leaderboards and explorer, independent of discovery listing  
📁 GQTs remain absent from homepage discovery and featured areas until trust threshold is met  
📘 Documentation clearly explains discovery listing requirements and trust score criteria

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Reward Pool Organisers Level 0  
#### Affordance: (1) View Mock Tournament / Claim Logic

**Definition:**  
At Level 0, the **Founders act as the initial Reward Pool Organisers**, directly configuring and operating mock tournament prize logic within the MVP environment. This visibility is not passive — Founders actively set up leaderboard → claim flows, define preliminary prize distribution models, and validate configuration rules. All activity is conducted in a fully **mock environment** with no live token routing, ensuring safe testing of the reward pool pipeline before public organisers are introduced.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance ensures that the foundational prize logic and claim process are established by the very stakeholders responsible for shaping the protocol’s operational standards. By running the first end-to-end simulations themselves, Founders:  
- Define the baseline logic and workflows that all future organisers will inherit  
- Identify configuration gaps or misalignments before the protocol schema is finalised  
- Test leaderboard integration, claim triggers, and prize calculation methods in real operational conditions (without economic consequence)  
- Establish clear documentation and configuration precedents for onboarding later organisers  

This is not merely observation — it is **operational implementation** that directly influences the structural integrity of all future reward pool operations.

**Dependencies:**  
- **Core Developers**: Must build and maintain mock leaderboard, prize logic, and claim routing systems for Level 0 testing  
- **Founders**: As organisers, must configure, run, and refine mock tournaments to generate validated baseline prize logic

**Failure Risk:**  
- Flawed logic introduced at this stage risks becoming embedded into the core protocol, impacting all future organisers  
- Missing or poorly tested configuration rules could lead to payout errors or exploitable logic when live tokens are introduced  
- Overlooking adaptability needs may result in rigid systems that fail to accommodate diverse GQT formats later on  

**Proof:**  
🧪 Mock tournaments successfully configured and run end-to-end  
📊 Leaderboard-to-claim flow validated without errors  
📁 Prize logic definitions recorded and linked to protocol documentation  
📘 Early organiser guidelines drafted for future onboarding reference  

Status: ⏳ Drafting

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Reward Pool Organisers Level 0  
#### Affordance: (2) Simulate Fees (No Live Token Routing)

**Definition:**  
At this stage, Reward Pool Organisers operate in a fully mock environment with no live CGT token movement. Their sole functional focus is simulating **fee structures** for hypothetical tournaments and reward pools, testing percentage splits, fixed fee models, or hybrid approaches without executing any on-chain transactions. This provides a risk-free environment to evaluate how fee logic interacts with leaderboard and claim systems.

**Strategic Function:**  
By running fee simulations early, organisers (initially the founders acting as seed organisers) can refine baseline economic models for later prize pools. These tests create the first feedback loop for fee percentages, organiser incentives, and fairness models, all without treasury exposure. This narrow focus at Level 0 is intended to **scale directly into the broader Level 1 toolkit**—where fee simulation becomes one part of a larger prize logic framework that also includes routing options, mock reward splits, and schematic prize design.

**Dependencies:**  
- **Founders:** act as initial organisers to seed tournament fee scenarios  
- **Core Developers:** implement mock fee simulation logic in the backend  
- **Protocol Schema:** define how fee parameters will be structured and stored in config  
- **Ecosystem Builders:** may observe outputs to inform future dashboard/overlay design  

**Failure Risk:**  
- Without this affordance, there is no pre-launch validation of fee models  
- Organisers would enter Level 1 without tested assumptions on sustainable fee percentages

- Early economic modelling opportunities would be lost  

**Proof:**  
🧪 Mock fee scenarios can be created and adjusted in a simulation tool  
📊 Outputs show percentage breakdowns and projected organiser rewards  
📁 Fee models are stored according to the protocol schema (even in mock form)  
📘 Documentation exists for interpreting fee simulation results

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Reward Pool Organisers Level 1  
#### Affordance: (1) Simulate Prize Logic Using Config Schema

**Definition:**  
At Level 1, Reward Pool Organisers use the published **config schema** to define and simulate prize logic for GQTs (main and Shareable Drafts). Configurable fields include (illustrative): `rewardSplits`, `eligibilityBands`, `tieBreakers`, `claimWindows`, and `payoutOrder`. Simulations run **off‑chain** against leaderboard outputs and produce **mock** reward allocations (no live treasury routing).

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance moves organisers from Level‑0 fee tinkering to **full prize‑model prototyping**. By expressing prize rules in schema‑valid configs, organisers can iterate on reward bands, fairness curves, and timing windows, then immediately see their effects on mock leaderboard results. It establishes a repeatable, testable path from **design → simulate → review**, preparing both creators and the platform for later on‑chain equivalents.

**Dependencies:**  
- **Core Developers** — expose/validate the prize‑related config schema; provide simulation endpoints producing mock allocations from leaderboard data.  
- **Players** — generate leaderboard results that the simulation consumes.  
- **3rd‑Party GQT Creators** — publish Shareable Draft GQTs whose configs reference the same schema, enabling cross‑testing.  
- **Founders** — set policy guardrails (e.g., minimum claim windows, anti‑abuse tie‑breakers) and approve schema changes.

**Failure Risk:**  
- If prize logic is not expressed via schema (or poorly validated), organisers drift into ad‑hoc rules that won’t survive later contractization.  
- Missing guardrails (e.g., tie‑breakers/eligibility bands) lead to ambiguous or gameable outcomes.  
- Inconsistent simulations undermine trust in later reward pools and slow creator adoption.

**Proof:**  
🧪 A schema‑valid prize config (JSON/YAML) runs through a simulation endpoint and returns mock allocations per rank/band.  
📊 Simulation outputs reference a specific leaderboard/gameBlock and are reproducible.  
📁 Configs pass validation (schema version, required fields, allowed ranges) and are stored for audit.  
📘 Short guide shows “design → simulate → review” with examples and common pitfalls.

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Reward Pool Organisers Level 1  
#### Affordance: (2) Explore Routing Options (Sandbox TestCGT → Published MockCGT)

**Definition:**  
At Level 1, Reward Pool Organisers design and test reward **routing policies** across two pre‑launch contexts:
- **Shareable Draft (TestCGT)** — creator‑hosted drafts using the test economy.
- **Published (MockCGT)** — published GQTs using the platform’s mock economy.

Routing policies specify *where* simulated rewards are recorded for later claims (e.g., per‑GQT mock ledgers or player‑scoped balances). All routing remains **off‑chain**; no live treasury movement occurs.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance standardizes routing behavior across **Draft** and **Published** states. Organisers prove that one policy, expressed in schema‑valid config, behaves predictably in both contexts—preserving eligibility, timing, and auditability. That consistency is the bridge from pre‑launch simulations to future on‑chain routing.

**Dependencies:**  
- **Core Developers** — expose routing policy fields in the config schema; provide dual‑context simulation endpoints (`executionContext: "testCGT" | "mockCGT"`); persist mock allocation records.  
- **3rd‑Party GQT Creators** — supply GQTs in Shareable Draft and Published states to exercise the policy in both contexts.  
- **Players** — generate leaderboard results that the routing simulation consumes.  
- **Founders** — define guardrails (no cross‑context leakage, consistent claim windows, minimum audit fields).

**Failure Risk:**  
- Context divergence (Draft vs. Published) causes inconsistent allocations or claimability.  
- Missing audit fields block Explorer/History visibility and reduce trust.  
- Over‑customized policies per context create migration pain when drafts are published.  
- Ambiguous schema fields yield organiser‑specific “house rules” that won’t contractize cleanly.

**Proof:**  
🧩 A routing policy exists inside a prize config and **validates** against the current schema (including `executionContext`).  
🧪 The **same config** is executed in **TestCGT** and **MockCGT** contexts and returns allocations without errors.  
📄 A small **parity check artifact** (e.g., `routing-parity.json`) shows allocations are consistent for identical inputs.  
🔎 Mock allocation records are **queryable** by Explorer/History (fields: `gqtId`, `gameBlockId`, `wallet`, `amount`, `context`).  
📘 A brief doc note explains how to run Draft → Published routing with the same policy.

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Reward Pool Organisers Level 1  
#### Affordance: (3) Explore Fee Logic

**Definition:**  
Reward Pool Organisers can access and experiment with the mock fee logic that governs reward pool allocations, including platform fees, creator fees, and any configured organiser fees. This affordance supports the creation of fee structures for both the main game and 3rd-party GQTs, showing how these interact with the CGT protocol’s overall distribution model over the 24-month reward cycle. If no external organiser is set, **founders, core developers, or 3rd-party GQT creators act as default organisers for their respective GQTs and draft GQTs during this stage**.

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance enables organisers to test how different fee structures affect reward distribution and stakeholder payouts without touching live treasury funds. It also prepares them to communicate fee breakdowns transparently to players and other stakeholders. By simulating platform-level fees, creator fees, and organiser fees, organisers can optimise for sustainability, fairness, and competitiveness before live deployment.

**Dependencies:**  
- Core Developers: must implement mock fee calculation tools in the organiser dashboard.  
- 3rd-Party GQT Creators: may configure and test their own fee logic for their GQTs.  
- Founders: set baseline platform fee parameters in the mock environment.  

**Failure Risk:**  
- Without early exploration, organisers may misjudge the balance between sustainability and player appeal.  
- Incorrect fee assumptions could cause friction when moving from mock to live environments.  
- Lack of early alignment between platform and creator fee logic may require disruptive changes post-launch.  

**Proof:**  
🧪 Organisers generate multiple fee configurations and observe their impact in mock payout simulations.  
📊 Mock dashboard displays clear breakdown of platform, creator, and organiser fee allocations.  
📁 Fee configurations are stored and retrievable for iteration.  
📘 Documentation explains how fee logic integrates into overall CGT distribution mechanics.  

Status: ✅ Locked


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Reward Pool Organisers Level 1  
#### Affordance: (4) Explore Mock Reward Splits

**Definition:**  
Reward Pool Organisers simulate **reward splits** in both **draft environments using TestCGT** and **mock environments using MockCGT**. Splits explicitly include **staking commission splits alongside platform, creator, and organiser fees**, with wallet addresses specified for each recipient. Simulations verify that routing behaves as intended across gameBlocks and GQTs before live deployment or indexing.

**Strategic Function:**  
By exercising split logic (including staking commissions) ahead of launch, organisers surface fairness issues, UX clarity gaps, and routing edge cases early. These simulations create a dependable baseline that early stakeholders requiring to organise and test reward pools can rely on.Stakers can later consume for incentive-difficulty modelling and that Founders can use to tune platform policy without touching live funds.

**Dependencies:**  
- **Core Developers** – provide split configuration UI + routing simulators for TestCGT/MockCGT.  
- **Protocol Schema** – defines standard split fields (platform/creator/organiser/**staking commission**) and wallet assignment rules.  
- **3rd-Party GQT Creators** – supply organiser/creator wallet details for their own GQTs when acting as organisers.  
- **Founders** – set baseline platform split parameters for testing.

**Failure Risk:**  
- Missing staking commission handling causes downstream misalignment with staking incentives.  
- Misconfigured wallet routing leads to incorrect allocations at launch.  
- Inconsistent split semantics across GQTs undermines perceived fairness and trust.  
- Lack of dual-environment testing (TestCGT + MockCGT) hides discrepancies that surface post-launch.

**Proof:**  
🧪 TestCGT simulations show correct routing to **platform/creator/organiser/staking commission** wallets.  
🧪 MockCGT simulations show identical logic and totals across equivalent scenarios.  
📊 Split reports enumerate percentage and absolute amounts for each recipient, per gameBlock.  
📘 Docs specify required split fields and wallet validation rules (incl. staking commission split).

Status: ✅ Locked


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Stakers Level 0  
#### Affordance: (1) No action at MVP; staking mechanics not live, no reward influence  

**Definition:**  
At Level 0, external stakers cannot participate directly in rewards. However, the **staking framework is anticipated**: difficulty-style reward adjustments are planned, mirroring the adaptive competitiveness of Bitcoin mining rather than halving schedules. Core schema must therefore **reserve routing slots for staking commissions**, even if dormant, to prevent adoption risks or later conflicts.  

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance ensures that stakers are “in the picture” from the outset, even if inactive. By embedding dormant commission logic into routing schemas, other stakeholders (Reward Pool Organisers, Founders, Core Developers) can design and test around future staking needs. Early projections tie difficulty adjustments to ecosystem adoption rates, giving Founders a planning lens and Developers a technical roadmap for schema hooks. This avoids resistance when stakers activate and ensures fee structures remain future-proof.  

**Dependencies:**  
- **Founders**: define difficulty curve assumptions and project adoption-linked adjustments.  
- **Core Developers**: implement dormant commission slots in routing schemas and document difficulty adjustment logic.  
- **Reward Pool Organisers**: include placeholder staking commissions in simulated fee splits for draft and mock environments.  
- **Players**: generate participation data that will eventually inform staking difficulty adjustments.  

**Failure Risk:**  
- Without dormant commission slots, adding staking later may trigger schema rewrites, fee conflicts, or resistance from organisers/creators.  
- Confusing staking with halving could misalign incentive design and erode credibility.  
- Lack of early simulation deprives Founders and Developers of foresight into balancing rewards across stakeholders.  

**Proof:**  
🧪 Schema includes dormant “staking commission” routing slot visible in config but set to 0% at MVP.  
📊 Reward Pool Organiser simulations display placeholder staking allocations alongside platform, creator, and organiser splits.  
📘 Documentation distinguishes halving (distribution schedule) from difficulty-style staking rewards.  
📈 Early projections tie simulated staking difficulty to ecosystem participation metrics.  

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting  


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Stakers Level 1  
#### Affordance: (1) Monitor Staking Mechanics in Theory

**Definition:**  
Stakers (primarily Founders/Core Developers acting as proto-stakers at this stage) **monitor and model** staking incentives off-chain. They do not stake real CGT yet; instead they analyse projected yields and difficulty-style adjustments using simulated inputs from fee/split scenarios and adoption projections.

**Strategic Function:**  
This establishes a data-driven bridge between **fee/split design** and **future staking incentives**, ensuring the protocol won’t over- or under-reward stake when live. The modelling helps pre-empt adoption traps by aligning staking attractiveness with platform growth phases.

**Dependencies:**  
- **Reward Pool Organisers** – provide mock fee routing outputs **including staking commission splits** that feed into staking incentive calculations.  
- **Founders** – publish provisional staking policy levers (e.g., difficulty curve parameters) for modelling.  
- **Core Developers** – expose read-only reports/exports of split simulations and usage metrics to drive forecasting.  

**Failure Risk:**  
- If staking incentive models ignore staking commission splits, live rewards can become misaligned with actual treasury flows.  
- Lack of read-only access to organiser simulations blocks meaningful projections.  
- Overly optimistic assumptions (without organiser data) risk later rework and trust erosion.

**Proof:**  
📈 Internal spreadsheet/notebook models consume organiser split exports (incl. staking commission split) and output projected APR bands.  
🗂️ Versioned “Staking Modelling Notes” link scenarios to specific organiser simulation runs.  
🧪 Sensitivity tests show how changes in split percentages or activity levels affect projected staking yields.

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Ecosystem Builders Level 0  
#### Affordance: (1) See structure of GQT/score claims; can architect future layers  

**Definition:**  
At Level 0, Ecosystem Builders primarily observe and interpret the structures being created by Founders and Core Developers. Their affordance is to **see the early scaffolding of GQT composition, score claim pathways, and schema outlines**, giving them the foundation to imagine overlays, tools, and integrations for future levels. This role is less about execution and more about **clarifying visibility** into what exists, so later efforts can plug into a coherent framework.  

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance marks the separation between **Core Developers building for function** and **Ecosystem Builders planning for community-facing growth**. By observing system flows and schema visibility, they can identify what elements will need tooling (dashboards, explorers, APIs) and what gaps could create friction for external builders. Their role is critical in preparing the environment for expansion by ensuring transparency and planning alignment from the start.  

**Dependencies:**  
- Founders: provide protocol narrative and schema draft visibility.  
- Core Developers: surface mock leaderboard, claims, and explorer logic for observation.  
- Reward Pool Organisers: their mock simulations must be visible for ecosystem mapping.  

**Failure Risk:**  
- If visibility is poor at this stage, future ecosystem builders may lack the clarity to design overlays or plan integrations.  
- Without separation from core development, ecosystem building may be reduced to ad-hoc developer tasks, limiting growth.  
- Misinterpretation of scaffolding could lead to tools being planned against unstable or changing elements.  

**Proof:**  
🧩 Access to protocol schema drafts (read-only).  
📊 Visibility of leaderboard and claim logic in mock form.  
📘 Early notes or diagrams capturing how these flows appear from a system-wide view.  
🧪 Evidence of builders beginning to sketch overlays or potential tools (even informally).  

Status: ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Ecosystem Builders Level 1  
#### Affordance: (1) Build overlays

**Definition:**  
Ecosystem Builders create lightweight, read-only visual layers that sit atop Core Developer outputs (mock game flow, score submission, leaderboard state). Overlays render live indicators—e.g., score velocity, rank deltas, gameBlock timers—without modifying protocol logic or storage.

**Strategic Function:**  
Overlays turn raw system behavior into human-legible signals for Players, Founders, and Marketing. They accelerate feedback loops during Level 1 by exposing timing, fairness, and performance characteristics in real time, supporting narrative clarity and early trust without adding new rules.

**Dependencies:**  
- **Core Developers:** stable endpoints for mock game sessions, score submission, and leaderboard rankings (L1 Dev affordances 1–3).  
- **Founders:** narrative cues (what to visualize and why) so overlays reinforce protocol story and testing goals.  
- **Players:** live traffic to generate meaningful telemetry (scores, session events).  
- **3rd‑Party GQT Creators:** sandbox/shareable drafts to broaden overlay coverage beyond the main game.  
- **Protocol Schema:** field names and IDs for scores, gameBlocks, and ranks to ensure overlay queries remain compatible.

**Failure Risk:**  
- If overlays don’t exist, stakeholders fly blind on timing, fairness, and rank dynamics.  
- If overlays couple tightly to unstable fields, breakage occurs when schemas iterate.  
- Misleading visuals (e.g., mixing draft vs. mock environments) can erode trust and confuse Marketing materials.  
- Lack of SLAs/health checks can make overlays unreliable during demos.

**Proof:**  
🧪 Overlay connects to read-only endpoints; no write access.  
📊 Live panels display rank deltas, gameBlock countdowns, and submission throughput.  
🧩 Works across main mock game and at least one shareable draft GQT.  
🔁 Basic resilience: tolerates schema version bumps using a lightweight adapter or mapping.  
📸 Screenshots/GIFs included in docs for Marketing & Founder updates.

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Ecosystem Builders Level 1  
#### Affordance: (2) Build dashboards  

**Description:**  
Ecosystem Builders create dashboards that consolidate data from the mock protocol (scores, leaderboards, claims, gameBlocks) into usable, visual interfaces. Dashboards should allow Founders, Developers, and other stakeholders to track system activity at a glance, without digging into raw API calls or databases.  

**Strategic Function:**  
Dashboards act as the **ecosystem’s lens** on itself — the first layer where stakeholders see the protocol as a whole rather than isolated parts. They enable Founders to validate assumptions, Developers to monitor performance, and Marketing to present screenshots or walkthroughs. They also prepare the ground for Explorers and public interfaces later.  

**Dependencies:**  
- **Core Developers** must have working leaderboard and claim logic (mock state acceptable).  
- **Founders** provide KPI definitions (what to track, how to measure).  
- **Players** and **Reward Pool Organisers** generate the activity that populates dashboards.  

**🚫 Failure Risk:**  
If dashboards are missing or underdeveloped:  
- Stakeholders will be blind to system progress and rely only on scattered API endpoints.  
- Founders lose visibility on whether KPIs (claims, rewards, score flows) match expectations.  
- Marketing lacks visual tools to communicate system maturity.  
- Ecosystem Builders risk being sidelined into ad hoc tooling rather than structured overlays.  

**✅ Proof:**  
- 🖥️ A functional dashboard UI is accessible and loads without error.  
- 📊 Charts and tables display **live mock data** (not static screenshots).  
- 🔄 At least one interactive control (filter, toggle, or refresh) updates the view.  
- 📑 Data shown aligns with a Founder-defined KPI (e.g., leaderboard ranks, claim counts).  

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting  

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Ecosystem Builders Level 1  
#### Affordance: (3) Build testnet tools using mock data

**Description**  
Ecosystem Builders create utilities that mimic testnet‑style experimentation without requiring live contracts or on‑chain deployment. These tools let contributors rehearse blockchain flows in a safe mock environment. Examples: block replay scripts, score/claim injectors, schema validators, and claim stress‑testers.

**Strategic Function**  
Mock testnet tools de‑risk the eventual move to real testnets. They enable edge‑case simulation, validate evolving schemas, and rehearse cycles like leaderboard closure, claim timing, and block restarts. They also accelerate onboarding: new contributors can practice with realistic flows before any token or contract is live.

**Dependencies**  
- **Core Developers** — provide mock leaderboard, claim, and reward logic as data sources.  
- **Founders** — use tool outputs to validate pacing, reward fairness, and schema robustness.  
- **Players** — benefit from previews of future blockchain‑style interactions.  
- **Reward Pool Organisers** — dry‑run prize logic in a sandbox prior to live routing.

**Failure Risk**  
- No safe way to experiment or test new ideas.  
- Edge cases (duplicate claims, malformed payloads) go untested.  
- Onboarding is slower; contributors learn only after testnet launch.  
- Migration to real testnets becomes riskier and more error‑prone.

**Proof**  
🛠️ Replay tool re‑runs mock gameBlocks against leaderboard logic.  
📑 Schema validator checks sample payloads against protocol rules.  
⚡ Stress‑tester simulates high‑volume score submissions and claims.  
📈 Logs/dashboards record test cycles for Founder/Dev review.

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Ecosystem Builders Level 1  
#### Affordance: (4) Align early tooling to evolving schemas  

**Description:**  
Ecosystem Builders create tools that keep pace with the evolving protocol schemas drafted by Founders and Developers. At this level, alignment is not enforced but demonstrated through overlays, dashboards, or testnet utilities that adopt the latest schema changes. The aim is to show feasibility of schema-driven tooling without guaranteeing permanent stability.  

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance ensures Ecosystem Builders stay tightly coupled with protocol evolution. By adapting their tools to schema changes, they act as the first external validators of schema usability, highlighting issues before wider adoption. Their efforts help Founders and Developers see how schema drafts behave in “live” mock environments and prepare for cross-stakeholder use.  

**Dependencies:**  
- **Founders** – supply evolving schema drafts that Builders must track.  
- **Core Developers** – publish mock API/data outputs that Builders consume.  
- **Players/Creators** – indirectly benefit when Builders produce schema-aligned utilities for history, leaderboard, or reward previews.  

**Failure Risk:**  
If tooling drifts from the evolving schema:  
- Builders may produce overlays that misrepresent protocol behavior.  
- Founders/Devs lose valuable feedback on schema usability.  
- Players/Creators interacting with these tools may be misled by outdated data.  
- Schema changes risk being adopted too slowly or without external validation.  

**Proof:**  
- ✅ Tools demonstrate adoption of the latest available schema drafts.  
- ✅ Dashboards and overlays provide a way to reflect updated data structures.  
- ✅ Builders can show working examples where schema changes are incorporated into their outputs.  
- ✅ Gaps or mismatches between schema drafts and tools are logged for Founders/Devs to address.  

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting  


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Service Providers Level 0  
#### Affordance: (1) Begin identifying integration and monitoring opportunities  

**Description:**  
At Level 0, Service Providers are not independent operators but *proto-enablers*. Their main role is to read early outputs from Founders, Developers, and Marketing, then reframe them into usable context for new or less-technical creators. This includes spotting where integration challenges might arise, noting monitoring gaps, and suggesting simplified workflows that make protocol drafts or MVP features more understandable.  

**Strategic Function:**  
The Service Provider affordance ensures that the ecosystem’s earliest complexity does not overwhelm new entrants. By identifying and communicating integration and monitoring opportunities, they act as interpreters — turning schema drafts, whitepaper notes, and roadmap items into onboarding-friendly context. This provides a softer entry point for 3rd-Party Creators who may not have deep technical expertise but still need to design around early protocol concepts.  

**Dependencies:**  
- **Founders (0.0)** – provide roadmap control and protocol authority as the raw material Service Providers interpret.  
- **Core Developers (0.0)** – publish MVP schemas/drafts which Service Providers simplify into practical context.  
- **Marketing & Operations (0.0)** – supply comms (whitepaper, website, Telegram/CMC) that Service Providers extend into user-focused guides.  
- **3rd-Party GQT Creators (0.1)** – benefit directly from simplified guidance when starting to conceptualize GQTs.  
- **Ecosystem Builders (0.1)** – create prototypes; Service Providers translate or explain those prototypes for less-technical audiences.  

**Failure Risk:**  
If Service Providers fail at this stage:  
- Early creators may misinterpret schema drafts or struggle with onboarding.  
- Marketing/whitepaper outputs remain too abstract to be applied.  
- Developers and Founders lose indirect feedback on how their drafts “land” with non-technical participants.  
- The path to Level 1 creator activity becomes steeper, slowing ecosystem growth.  

**Proof:**  
- ✅ Early guides exist that simplify schema or MVP logic for creators.  
- ✅ Feedback loops form where Service Providers highlight onboarding challenges to Founders/Devs.  
- ✅ Community channels (Telegram/website) include explanatory posts beyond raw comms.  
- ✅ New creators begin to use protocol drafts without heavy Dev/Founder handholding.  

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting  


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Service Providers Level 1  
#### Affordance 1: (1) Begin interpreting protocol drafts through a service lens  

**Description:**  
At Level 1, Service Providers move from passive observers into **active interpreters of protocol drafts**. Their role is to take early schemas, mock flows, and scaffolding produced by Founders and Developers, and filter them through a **service-oriented perspective**. The outcome is **structured insights that anticipate creator needs**, highlight potential friction, and map where service interventions could matter most.  

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance establishes Service Providers as the **ecosystem’s first translators of technical intent into service meaning**. They don’t build tools or deliver solutions yet — but by reading drafts through a service lens, they lay the foundation for future onboarding, documentation, and operational pathways.  

**Dependencies:**  
- **Founders** – depend on finalized scaffolding and schema narrative as the core material for interpretation.  
- **Core Developers** – depend on mock flows (leaderboard, scoring, gating, claims) as the technical baseline to analyze.  
- **Marketing & Operations** – provide early guides and framing that Service Providers cross-reference when interpreting for service relevance.  

**Failure Risk:**  
If Service Providers fail to interpret protocol drafts:  
- Blind spots remain in schema design, leading to higher onboarding friction later.  
- Service interventions emerge too late, forcing reactive fixes instead of proactive pathways.  
- Developers and Founders shoulder all explanation load, slowing ecosystem readiness.  

**Proof:**  
- ✅ Evidence of **draft annotations or service-lens summaries** circulated internally.  
- ✅ Documentation that highlights **service gaps in protocol drafts**.  
- ✅ Clearer marketing/creator guides emerge when aligned with Service Provider insights.  

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting  


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – Service Providers Level 1  
#### Affordance 2: (2) Support GQT Creators by explaining or summarizing process steps  

**Description:**  
At Level 1, Service Providers actively **bridge the gap between protocol drafts and creator action**. They summarize mock flows and schema into **step-by-step onboarding sequences**, guiding 3rd-Party GQT Creators who are experimenting with sandbox or shareable draft GQTs.  

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance positions Service Providers as **frontline enablers of creator momentum**. By providing structured service explanations, they reduce friction, ensure GQTs move beyond conceptual form, and accelerate the flow of draft GQTs into usable outputs.  

**Dependencies:**  
- **3rd-Party GQT Creators** – Service Providers only activate meaningfully once sandbox/draft GQTs exist that require guidance.  
- **Founders** – provide finalized scaffolding and schema narrative for translation into onboarding steps.  
- **Core Developers** – deliver the mock flows that Service Providers reshape into clear creator pathways.  
- **Marketing & Operations** – publish stats, narratives, and guides that Service Providers adapt into actionable sequences.  

**Failure Risk:**  
If Service Providers fail to support creators:  
- Sandbox GQTs may stall at conceptual level.  
- Misinterpretations of schema could lead to invalid GQT designs.  
- Developers face unsustainable explanation demand.  
- Early creator energy is lost, weakening the ecosystem pipeline.  

**Proof:**  
- ✅ Observable **correlation between intentional Service Provider activity and improved ecosystem stats** (Creators, Players, Organisers, etc.).  
- ✅ Guides, notes, or onboarding aids that clearly derive from mock flows and schema.  
- ✅ Increased number and quality of draft GQTs traceable to Service Provider intervention.  
- ✅ Demonstrable reduction in repeated explanation requests to Developers or Founders.  

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting  


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – DAO / Sub-DAOs Level 0  
#### Affordance: (1) Passive Schema Monitoring  

**Description:**  
At Level 0, the DAO exists only in a **dormant, observational state**. It has no governance powers, treasury routing, or proposal mechanisms. Its sole affordance is to **track and observe protocol schema drafts and ecosystem evolution** across all nine other stakeholder roles. This “sleeping mirror” function ensures that when DAO activation does occur, it awakens with a contextual memory of how the system reached its current state.  

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance gives the DAO a foundational baseline: it is *aware* of ecosystem development without yet influencing it. By quietly monitoring schema changes, mock implementations, and stakeholder affordances, the DAO builds continuity and prepares for its future role as a coordinating body. This prevents “cold-start blindness,” ensuring that once proposals and treasury control are introduced, DAO members can reference a history of decisions and structures already in motion.  

**Dependencies:**  
- **Founders** – define the initial protocol scaffolding and schema drafts the DAO tracks.  
- **Core Developers** – produce mock implementations (leaderboard, claims, explorer) that serve as observable anchors.  
- **Marketing & Operations** – distribute documentation and comms that indirectly inform what the DAO is aware of.  
- **All Stakeholders** – by exercising their Level 0 affordances, they generate the activity the DAO mirrors.  

**Failure Risk:**  
If this affordance is ignored or underdeveloped:  
- DAO activation risks beginning with no historical grounding, creating weak legitimacy.  
- Stakeholder tensions may arise later if early processes weren’t passively tracked.  
- Ecosystem memory is fragmented, forcing future governance to “reinvent” context.  
- Protocol evolution could lose credibility if DAO oversight appears disconnected.  

**Proof:**  
- ✅ DAO reference docs or logs showing awareness of schema drafts and affordance expansions.  
- ✅ Alignment notes demonstrating continuity between early mock systems and DAO-visible state.  
- ✅ Evidence that DAO has *tracked but not acted* at this stage (no proposals, no treasury control).  
- ✅ Schema snapshots stored with “DAO-observed” tag in documentation or version history.  

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting  


### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – DAO / Sub-DAOs Level 1  
#### Affordance: (1) Passive Schema Monitoring  

**Definition:**  
At Level 1, the DAO remains non-governing but upgrades from generic observation to **schema-indexed monitoring**. It records the appearance and evolution of stakeholder artifacts (e.g., `scoreEntry`, `claimEntry`, `GQTConfigDraft`, `feeConfig`, `schemaVersion`, `guideDocRef`) and tags them by stakeholder type, version, and timestamp. No proposals, voting, or fund routing occur.  

**Strategic Function:**  
This creates a verifiable readiness ledger for future activation. By passively tracking which stakeholders are producing which artifacts (and how those artifacts change over time), the DAO establishes the evidence base needed for later trust thresholds, indexing eligibility, and weight-setting — without influencing outcomes yet.  

**Dependencies:**  
- **Founders (L1):** finalized scaffolding & core schema provide the artifact namespaces and version fields the DAO indexes.  
- **Core Developers (L1):** mock flows (leaderboard, score, claims, gating) emit entries the DAO can tag and count.  
- **3rd-Party GQT Creators (L1):** sandbox/shareable drafts generate `GQTConfigDraft` & related metadata for monitoring.  
- **Reward Pool Organisers (L1):** mock configs/fee splits surface routable parameters to observe (no funds moved).  
- **Marketing & Ops (L1):** published guides create `guideDocRef`/onboarding artifacts that can be referenced as ecosystem signals.  
- **Players (L1):** score/claim histories form the activity baseline the DAO passively tallies.  

**Failure Risk:**  
- Without schema-indexed monitoring, the DAO will later lack auditable provenance for trust scores and activation thresholds.  
- Readiness becomes anecdotal, making governance timing contentious.  
- Indexing/listing criteria can’t be justified with evidence, undermining credibility.  

**Proof:**  
- ✅ A passive registry (read-only) that logs artifact type, stakeholder tag, version, and timestamp.  
- ✅ Basic counts/indicators (e.g., “draft GQTs active,” “claims recorded this block,” “schemaVersion in use”).  
- ✅ Documentation describing that the DAO observes but does not influence at L1 (no proposals/votes/treasury).  
- ✅ Sample snapshots showing cross-stakeholder artifact coverage (players, creators, devs, organisers, marketing).  

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting  

### 🎯 Affordance Strategy Reflection – DAO / Sub-DAOs Level 1  
#### Affordance: (2) Awaiting full system readiness before DAO ladder activates  

**Description:**  
At Level 1, the DAO does not take part in governance or decision-making. Its role is to **log readiness signals** across all other stakeholders, ensuring that when the DAO ladder eventually activates, its baseline is accurate and aligned with the real ecosystem state. The DAO functions as a passive **tracking scaffold**, registering whether stakeholders are performing the activities expected of them at this stage.  

**Strategic Function:**  
This affordance clarifies the DAO’s preparatory role: it is **not yet governance**, but it is already **observing and recording**. By treating every stakeholder affordance as a “signal to be logged,” the DAO establishes the ground truth needed for later governance simulation. This ensures that no stakeholder can enter Level 2 claiming influence without a history of observable actions during Level 0 and Level 1.  

**Dependencies:**  
- **Founders** – DAO tracks whether scaffolding, schema drafts, and narrative frameworks exist as baseline protocol definitions.  
- **Core Developers** – DAO tracks whether mock flows (leaderboard, score submission, reward, claim) are live as readiness signals.  
- **Marketing & Operations** – DAO tracks whether guides, demos, or communications have been published to support ecosystem awareness.  
- **Players** – DAO tracks whether sandbox participation and claim attempts are happening, even in test CGT.  
- **3rd-Party GQT Creators** – DAO tracks whether sandbox or shareable draft GQTs are being created and circulated.  
- **Reward Pool Organisers** – DAO tracks whether mock configs or fee simulations are being run, regardless of treasury use.  
- **Stakers** – DAO tracks whether staking mechanics are being theorized or simulated as part of readiness prep.  
- **Ecosystem Builders** – DAO tracks whether overlays, dashboards, or schema-aligned tools are being prototyped.  
- **Service Providers** – DAO tracks whether onboarding or support activity for creators is happening, even informally.  

**Failure Risk:**  
If the DAO does not log these readiness signals:  
- Governance scaffolding may lack context when the ladder activates.  
- Stakeholders could claim influence without any traceable history.  
- Later DAO simulations (Level 2 Prep) would be ungrounded in reality, leading to skewed balances of power.  
- The ecosystem risks entering governance phases without a validated baseline.  

**Proof:**  
- ✅ DAO monitoring layer records stakeholder actions as metadata signals.  
- ✅ Schema or mock flows contain tags/logs that can be referenced later.  
- ✅ Dashboards or explorers surface read-only “readiness signals” tied to each stakeholder.  
- ✅ No proposals, votes, or treasury access are available at this stage.  

**Status:** ⏳ Drafting
