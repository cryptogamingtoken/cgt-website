**Status:** ✅ Locked – All Stakeholders Have Level 2 Prep Mapped  
📘 _Process Guide:_ [`guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`](guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md)
**Changelog:** Level 2 Prep completed for all 10 stakeholders. DAO simulation structure and dependency map added.  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-22

> 📓 **See Changelog:** [`changelog/stakeholder-evolution.md`](../changelog/stakeholder-evolution.md)

## 📊 Level 0 – System Genesis  
**Sprint ID:** pre‑R‑1z  
**Version Tag:** `v0.2.3-stakeholder-evolution`  
**Status:** ✅ Confirmed  

### 🔹 Overview
The following table outlines the initial state of all 10 stakeholder types at the launch of the CryptoGamingToken protocol.  
All stakeholders are assigned a baseline level `0.0`, or a sub-level `0.x` to represent contextual affordance, preparatory capacity, or passive visibility within the MVP structure.

---

### 🧩 Stakeholder Matrix – Level 0

| Stakeholder | Level | Affordances | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Founders** | 0.0 | Platform custodianship, roadmap control, protocol definition authority | Control narrative, initiate protocol, manage all roles |
| **Core Developers** | 0.0 | Build MVP backend/frontend, leaderboard, claims, explorer, wallet flow | Enable full working model, publish protocol schema draft |
| **Marketing & Operations** | 0.0 | Website publishing, whitepaper comms, community touchpoints (Telegram, CMC) | No DAO mechanics yet, but content powers high |
| **Players** | 0.0 | Enter main game, receive scores, claim mock rewards, appear in explorer | Direct gameplay affordance, mock wallet system enabled |
| **3rd-Party GQT Creators** | 0.1 | Protocol documentation available; cannot publish GQTs but can design around the config | Can develop conceptual GQTs but not participate in live protocol yet |
| **Reward Pool Organisers** | 0.1 | View mock tournament/claim logic; can simulate fees, not route real tokens | Systems visible; simulation enabled, no execution authority |
| **Stakers** | 0.0 | No action at MVP; staking mechanics not live, no reward influence | Awaiting protocol hooks or validator overlays |
| **Ecosystem Builders** | 0.1 | See structure of GQT/score claims; can architect future layers | Can prototype around system visibility |
| **CGT Service Providers** | 0.1 | Listed in theory only; no onboarding tools or trust flow yet | Can begin planning integrations or monitoring tooling direction |
| **DAO / Sub-DAOs** | 0.1 | No governance control or fund routing; passive observation only | Protocol visibility begins, but no active affordance |

---

### 🧠 Observations:
- Sub-levels (`0.1`) represent conceptual engagement and protocol alignment even without permission-based affordance
- No stakeholder has been artificially inflated above support systems
- First full-level unlocks will likely occur at Level 1, conditional on validator, staking, or publishing readiness

### 📎 Output Tag:
Sprint pre‑R‑1z – Stakeholder Evolution Matrix – Level-Based Progression Model  
To be updated in: `/protocol/theory/stakeholder-evolution.md`

## 🎯 Stakeholder Evolution Matrix – Level 1
**Version:** `v1.0.3-stakeholder-evolution`  
**Sprint:** `pre‑R‑1z – Stakeholder Evolution Matrix – Level-Based Progression Model`

This matrix defines the active affordances and readiness of each CGT stakeholder type at Level 1, capturing the simulated, conceptual, or preparatory roles they fulfill prior to real on-chain activation.

All affordances are validated through a full cross-stakeholder comparison and locked in via Misassumption Clearance Protocol.

### 🧩 DAO / Sub-DAOs  
**Level 2 Prep – Governance Simulation Layer**
The DAO scaffolding layer activates — not yet with proposal mechanics or token voting — but with traceable monitoring of influence from all 9 stakeholder types. This simulation stage ensures no stakeholder gains early dominance and that protocol rule-setting can be transparently aligned with real-world engagement.

---

#### ✅ Core Actions at This Level:
- Simulate **protocol-wide influence tracking** per stakeholder type.
- Enable **mock governance registry**: a system that logs tagged contributions (e.g. tool authorship, GQT publishing, staking, etc.).
- Begin surfacing **contribution-weighted metadata signals** on dashboards, profiles, and GQT listings (e.g. “community-backed,” “validator-confirmed”).
- DAO UI begins exposing *read-only simulation* of possible proposal flows, vote weights, and trust thresholds — but remains non-interactive.

| **Founders**                | Protocol publishing rules, lifecycle logic, and stakeholder ladders must be locked in.                                                  | Authorship of system schema and lifecycle maps tagged with wallet and timestamp.                                       | Founders must embed non-permanent authority in protocol rules (DAO replaces control).                                  |
| **Core Developers**         | Governance scaffolding logic must exist (config flags, registry tags, simulation layers).                                               | Git commits, schema tags, and off-chain governance model updates linked to contributor identities.                     | Influence fades unless active contributions continue. Developers cannot hard-code themselves into protocol logic.     |
| **Marketing & Operations**  | Must have published educational content on GQTs, protocol use, and ecosystem responsibilities.                                           | Indexed materials tied to wallet-authored metadata (docs, X threads, pinned pages).                                   | Influence increases only if community adoption traces back to verifiable authored resources.                          |
| **Players**                 | Must have participated in real GQTs and either claimed rewards or crossed minimum participation thresholds.                             | Score claim logs, token claims, leaderboard entries linked to wallet and time.                                         | DAO tracks total participation weight over time; bots and duplicate plays can be filtered by trust thresholds.        |
| **3rd-Party GQT Creators**  | Must have published GQTs at the “Shareable Draft” or “Published” stage with verifiable participation or validator review.               | Indexed GQTs by creator wallet, tagged with trust signals, and validator logs.                                         | Influence capped unless validators or the platform confirm legitimacy.                                                |
| **Reward Pool Organisers**  | Must have run mock or real reward pool configs visible to the platform and test users.                                                  | Config submission logs, payout rule simulations, fee routing visibility.                                               | Influence scales with pool volume and diversity; DAO can reweight underused configurations.                            |
| **Stakers**                 | Must be actively staking CGT tokens with visible lock-up commitments under protocol rules.                                              | On-chain staking contract data, visible lock-up durations, reward routing balances.                                   | Influence decays without ongoing stake or community alignment. Dynamic models can rebalance against token whales.     |
| **Ecosystem Builders**      | Must have created external tools or overlays that interface with CGT protocol (even in testnet/mock mode).                             | Tool registry, usage analytics, and references inside official docs or dashboards.                                     | DAO can use signal propagation logic to verify real-world use vs dormant codebases.                                   |
| **CGT Service Providers**   | Must have offered onboarding or support services tied to at least 1 GQT and verified by the client side (wallet or creator log).        | Service verification attestations or metadata tags (e.g. “onboardedBy”: walletX).                                      | DAO can audit service legitimacy; providers gain influence only with usage or trust confirmations.                    |
