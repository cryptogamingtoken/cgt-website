## `v0.2.3-stakeholder-evolution`
**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Status:** ✅ Confirmed  

### 🔄 Changes:
- Finalized Level 0 and Level 1 stakeholder matrix
- Added “sub-level” affordance definitions (`0.x`)
- Locked misassumption protocol for Level 1

## ✅ v2.0.0 Verification Summary  
**Status:** Complete  
**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Verified By:** Mr. Ridley

This document verifies that the following checklist was completed prior to tagging `v2.0.0-stakeholder-evolution`.

### 🧾 Verification Checklist

- [x] All 10 stakeholders have completed **Level 2 Prep** with structured dependencies and readiness signals.
- [x] DAO Simulation Layer added and cross-referenced with each stakeholder’s influence path and balance logic.
- [x] Markdown headers, sprint tags, and version metadata were reviewed and corrected where needed.
- [x] Erroneous or leftover Python snippets were removed from the source file (`stakeholder-evolution.md`).
- [x] Full file was saved, synced, and backed up in version control prior to new evolution phase.

## 🆕 Version: v2.0.1 – Stakeholder Evolution Process Guide Added
**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Author:** Mr. Ridley  
**Summary:**  
A formal process guide has been added to clarify the structure, steps, edge cases, and naming logic used for running Stakeholder Evolution Sprints. This enables future contributors (including the Master PM) to initiate or continue the evolution matrix with precision and consistency.

**Added:**
- [`/protocol/guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`](../guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md)

**Includes:**
- Full lifecycle workflow from kickoff to lock-in
- Edge case naming logic for stalled or split-level evolution
- Master PM chat management model
- Prep-loop compatibility for level holding, subprogression, and future catch-ups

🔁 This guide now governs all stakeholder evolution sprints from Level 2 onward.

🔐 Confirmed and approved under Misassumption Clearance Protocol.

## 📘 v0.2.3-stakeholder-evolution
**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Summary:**  
– Full L0 and L1 stakeholder matrices completed  
– L2 Prep conditions mapped for all 10 stakeholder types  
– DAO simulation logic defined  
– Misassumption Clearance Protocol applied to all unlock criteria  
– Finalized evolution logic model with sublevel notation and dynamic pathway for higher levels  
– Version sealed as foundation for Top50 evolution sprint series  

## 🆕 Version: v1.2.0 – Context-Aware Justification Standard Added  
**Date:** 2025-07-05  
**Author:** Assistant to Mr. Ridley  
**Linked Sprint:** `pre‑R‑1z – Stakeholder Evolution Matrix – L2 → L3 Prep`  

### 🔄 Changes:
- Added new section to `stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`:  
  **“📭 Context-Aware Justification Standard – v1.2.0”**
- Refines how readiness tags are justified across all stakeholder levels
- Requires real artifact references, cross-stakeholder awareness, and active state checking
- Prevents premature level tagging and assumption-based readiness inflation
- Applied to all future usage of:
  - `📐 Readiness Evaluation Template – L1 → L2`
  - `🧬 Misassumption Audits`
  - `L2 → L3` and higher unlock mapping

📎 Guide File: [`/protocol/guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`](../guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md)

🔐 Confirmed and approved for ecosystem-aligned readiness mapping.

## v1.3.0 – Artifact Derivation Method (Planning Phase Only)
**Date:** 2025-07-07  
**Sprint:** `pre‑R‑1z-primer – Ecosystem Artifact Logic Formulation`

### ✨ Summary
Introduced **Appendix A – Artifact Derivation (Planning Phase Only)** to the `stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`.  
This section defines how to reveal and track stakeholder artifacts during R‑0 through R‑X planning phases, particularly in `pre‑R‑1z` sprint cycles.

Artifacts are scoped strictly to `Draft` state and serve as planning tools to support readiness checks, not as formal deliverables.

---

### 📌 Key Additions
- New section: **Appendix A – Artifact Derivation (Planning Phase Only)**
- Defined lightweight method to track stakeholder-level artifacts based on next-level ceilings
- Clarified artifact states, purpose, stakeholder roles, and scope limits
- Included planning table template with examples

---

### 📁 Affected Files
- `protocol/guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`

---

### 🧠 Notes
This appendix is valid only during `R‑0` to `R‑X` and supports alignment across sprint chats and Master PM reviews.  
It does not replace or modify any R-stage definitions or evolution logic.
