**Author:** Assistant to Mr. Ridley  
**Scope:** `stakeholder-evolution.md`, `stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`, `matrix snapshots`, `reflections/`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### ✅ Summary

- Finalized Level 1 affordance structure for **Core Developers**
- Defined six numbered affordances:
  1. Build mock main game flow
  2. Simulate leaderboard ranking logic
  3. Implement score submission logic
  4. Create session-based token gating logic
  5. Simulate off-chain reward distribution
  6. Link leaderboard to mock claim system
- Authored full affordance strategy reflections for all six
- Aligned Level 1 matrix entries to exact affordance wording
- Labeled previous Level 0 schema entry explicitly for traceability
- Updated CGT Service Providers and DAO matrix rows to reflect Level 0.2 clarity

### 🧩 File Updates

- `stakeholder-evolution.md`: Matrix and affordance references updated  
- `reflections/core-developers/1-6.md`: New Level 1 affordance reflections  
- `stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`: No structural changes — reused formatting  
- `CHANGELOG.md`: This entry

🔐 This version locks Core Developer L1 as complete.

## 📄 stakeholder-evolution-guide.md  
**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Version:** `v1.5.0-stakeholder-evolution-guide`  
**File Updated:** `stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`  

### 🔧 Summary of Changes:
- Introduced **Appendix C – Schema Triggering Protocol**
  - Clarifies the role of affordances and artifacts in activating protocol schemas
  - Defines schema naming logic and file conventions (`/schema/v1/{role}/{name}.json`)
  - Establishes guidance on affordance-triggered vs artifact-derived schema modeling
  - Prevents premature schema complexity by requiring artifact-backing
- Reinforces artifact-first design philosophy across all future stakeholder-level schema integrations
- Minor edits to lifecycle references and clarification of naming conventions

### 📎 Notes:
- This addition aligns schema logic with stakeholder evolution strategy, preventing drift from unverifiable affordance assumptions
- Further schema-layer refinements may follow in a dedicated Schema Governance Guide (TBD)
- Supersedes version `v1.4.0` and marks the start of `v1.5.x` evolution infrastructure refinements

## 📄 stakeholder-evolution-guide.md  
**Date:** 2025-07-16  
**Version:** `v1.4.0-stakeholder-evolution-guide`  
**File Updated:** `stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`  

### 🔧 Summary of Changes:
- Overhauled **Sprint Lifecycle** to include 5 new steps:
  - Derive Affordances (Matrix vs Prep)
  - Affordance Expansion (Context Merge)
  - Derive Artifact Types from N+1 Prep
  - Derive Artifacts from Affordances + Prep
  - Capability Mapping Snapshot
- Refined the definition and placement of next-level readiness logic
- Fully integrated **Appendix A – Artifact Derivation Method**
- Aligned with current state of `pre‑R‑1z – Stakeholder Artifact Validation (L0/L1 Drafts)`
- Updated file header and lifecycle versioning to `v1.4.0`

### 📎 Notes:
- Supersedes version `v1.3.0`
- Enables readiness tracking before any live artifacts exist
- Forms the new foundation for all `pre‑R‑1z` sprint-level justifications


---

## v1.3.0 – Artifact Derivation Method (Planning Phase Only)
**Date:** 2025-07-07  
**Sprint:** `pre‑R‑1z-primer – Ecosystem Artifact Logic Formulation`

### ✨ Summary
Introduced **Appendix A – Artifact Derivation (Planning Phase Only)** to the `stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`.  
This section defines how to reveal and track stakeholder artifacts during R‑0 through R‑X planning phases, particularly in `pre‑R‑1z` sprint cycles.

Artifacts are scoped strictly to `Draft` state and serve as planning tools to support readiness checks, not as formal deliverables.

---

### 📌 Key Additions
- New section: **Appendix A – Artifact Derivation (Planning Phase Only)**
- Defined lightweight method to track stakeholder-level artifacts based on next-level ceilings
- Clarified artifact states, purpose, stakeholder roles, and scope limits
- Included planning table template with examples

---

### 📁 Affected Files
- `protocol/guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`

---

### 🧠 Notes
This appendix is valid only during `R‑0` to `R‑X` and supports alignment across sprint chats and Master PM reviews.  
It does not replace or modify any R-stage definitions or evolution logic.

## 🆕 Version: v1.2.0 – Context-Aware Justification Standard Added  
**Date:** 2025-07-05  
**Author:** Assistant to Mr. Ridley  
**Linked Sprint:** `pre‑R‑1z – Stakeholder Evolution Matrix – L2 → L3 Prep`  

### 🔄 Changes:
- Added new section to `stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`:  
  **“📭 Context-Aware Justification Standard – v1.2.0”**
- Refines how readiness tags are justified across all stakeholder levels
- Requires real artifact references, cross-stakeholder awareness, and active state checking
- Prevents premature level tagging and assumption-based readiness inflation
- Applied to all future usage of:
  - `📐 Readiness Evaluation Template – L1 → L2`
  - `🧬 Misassumption Audits`
  - `L2 → L3` and higher unlock mapping

📎 Guide File: [`/protocol/guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`](../guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md)

🔐 Confirmed and approved for ecosystem-aligned readiness mapping.

## 🆕 Version: v2.0.1 – Stakeholder Evolution Process Guide Added
**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Author:** Mr. Ridley  
**Summary:**  
A formal process guide has been added to clarify the structure, steps, edge cases, and naming logic used for running Stakeholder Evolution Sprints. This enables future contributors (including the Master PM) to initiate or continue the evolution matrix with precision and consistency.

**Added:**
- [`/protocol/guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md`](../guides/stakeholder-evolution-guide.md)

**Includes:**
- Full lifecycle workflow from kickoff to lock-in
- Edge case naming logic for stalled or split-level evolution
- Master PM chat management model
- Prep-loop compatibility for level holding, subprogression, and future catch-ups

🔁 This guide now governs all stakeholder evolution sprints from Level 2 onward.

🔐 Confirmed and approved under Misassumption Clearance Protocol.
